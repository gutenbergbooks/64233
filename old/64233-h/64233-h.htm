<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>Investigation into the history of the various and successive issues
of labels, wrappers, and envelopes connected with the Postal systems
of the British Colonies in North America does not present the difficulties
which had to be surmounted in the case of the Australian Colonies, and
perhaps does not therefore include subject matter of so interesting a
character as that comprised in the recent “Oceania” Catalogue.</p>

<p>Reference Lists of the North American Colonies have nevertheless
been hitherto crude, as well as deficient, and even incorrect in detail,
thus affording but superficial aid to the Philatelist: and the endeavour of
the Society in the following pages has been to amplify the information at
present in the possession of collectors; and by the collation of contents
of recent papers in Canadian and English journals, as well as by reference
to official gazettes and correspondence, to present as far as possible a
complete history of the Postal Service in these Colonies.</p>

<p>In this endeavour it has derived a large amount of assistance from
the researches of its late Secretary, Mr. E. D. Bacon, whose Notes at
the head of each Colony were originally intended to have been read
as a paper before the London Society, but which, by the desire of the
Committee entrusted with the revision and publication of the accompanying
lists, he has consented should be amalgamated with them, thus adding to
the completeness of the present work. The Society is also largely indebted
to Mr. Donald A. King for the permission to reproduce the valuable
contents of certain papers he contributed to the <i>Halifax Philatelist</i>.</p>

<p>The lists of Canada and Newfoundland, the only two of the Colonies
now using distinct stamps, have been completed to the end of June, 1889.</p>

<p>The same mode of illustration by the Autotype process, which proved
successful in the case of the “Stamps of Oceania,” has been adopted on
the present occasion, and is undoubtedly the most satisfactory of all
methods of reproduction in fac-simile which have come under the notice
of the Society.</p>

<h3>PRELIMINARY NOTES.</h3>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">By E. D. BACON.</span></i></p>

<p>Before laying before the members of the Society the few official notices I
have collected in reference to the Stamps of the North American Colonies,
I purpose prefacing what remarks I have to make in each case with a short <i>resumé</i> of
the history of each of the provinces. These historical particulars are taken for the
most part from <i>The Colonial Office List for 1889</i>, and are supplemented by additions
from one or two other works of reference.</p>

<p>British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America, and
comprises the territory between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast;
bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, and on the south by the United States,
the average breadth being about 250 miles, and the length of coast line 450 miles.
The area (including Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands) is about 341,000
square miles.</p>

<p>British Columbia was constituted a Crown Colony in 1858, owing to the large
immigration consequent on the discovery of gold in that year. Vancouver Island,
discovered in 1592 by Juan de Fuca, was leased to the Hudson’s Bay Company in
1843, and made a Crown Colony in 1819. In 1866 the colonies of British
Columbia and Vancouver Island were united, and on July 20th, 1871, British
Columbia entered the Dominion of Canada. Vancouver Island is sometimes called
<span class="smcap">Quadra</span>, after the Spanish commandant on the coast of the mainland, at the time
that the island was visited, in 1792, by the British naval officer, Captain George
Vancouver, from whom it derives its more usual name.</p>

<p>The earliest issue of <i>The Government Gazette, British Columbia</i>, I have been
able to find in this country is that of January 7th, 1865. This number contains the
following notices:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">General Post Office</span>, <i>8th June, 1864</i>.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“PUBLIC NOTICE.</p>

<p>“On and after the 20th day of June, 1864, all Letters and mail matter liable
to postage must be prepaid. Until other stamps shall have been substituted
there will be issued for the prepayment of postage the postage stamps at
present in use, bearing the mark 2½d., for which the sum of 3d. will in future
be charged.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">Warner R. Spalding</span>, <i>Postmaster-General</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">General Post Office</span>, <i>11th June, 1864</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The above no doubt first appeared in <i>The Gazette</i> about the middle of
June, 1864; but, as is customary with similar notices, copies were published in
subsequent numbers, and in this case continued to appear until the latter end
of 1865. Not having been fortunate enough to find a file of <i>The Gazette</i> for 1861—the
year the Two Pence Halfpenny stamp is said to have been first issued in—I am
unable to give the exact day this stamp came into use. I am inclined to think the
stamp was first solely used to prepay letters sent between New Westminster, the capital
of British Columbia, and Victoria, the capital of Vancouver Island. If this was so, we
see from the first of the above notices that this rate was raised one halfpenny in
June, 1864. It is apparent from the second notice that whatever distance the old
2½d. rate formerly paid, it was done away with or raised in the above month, as the
stamp was to be sold at 3d., pending the arrival of a new one bearing the higher value.
Perhaps it is as well for collectors that the idea of surcharging the Two Pence Half
penny stamp 3d. did not enter the Postmaster’s head, or there is no telling how many
varieties we should have had to add to our albums if the surcharge differed in
type, as it probably would have done. The escape was no doubt due to the fact
that at that time surcharges on stamps were few in number, and most likely altogether
unknown to the Postal authorities of British Columbia. This Two Pence Halfpenny
stamp is certainly admissable into a collection as a provisional Three Pence, provided
it, or the paper it is attached to, is postmarked after June 19th, 1864. Another
curious point in connection with the above notices is to know how the newspaper rate
of one penny was prepaid. The second notice distinctly says, “All Letters and
mail matter liable to postage must be prepaid.... There will be issued for the
prepayment of postage the postage stamps at present in use.” Was this Three
Penny provisional divided in any way like so many of the other North American
Colonies stamps, or was the postage, even in face of the notice, prepaid in coin?
One of these two alternatives naturally suggests itself to have been the case. I
have never seen or heard of a copy of this stamp divided; but as it could have
been only employed for newspapers sent by two special routes, the use of the stamp
would probably be small, and the fact that it was found upon newspapers alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
would account for the disappearance of specimens. We shall see from the next
notice I give that the provisional Three Penny stamp was in use down to the
1st November, 1865. This notice is taken from <i>The Gazette</i> for October 21st,
1865, and runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“NOTICE.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">General Post Office</span>, <i>28th September, 1865.</i></p>

<p>“It having been found necessary to issue a new postage stamp to meet the
requirements of the Postal Ordinance, 1864, notice is hereby given that from
and after the 1st November next the stamp at present in use will not be
received by the Post Office Department. Persons in possession of the stamp
at present in use may exchange the same on application at any of the Post-offices
of British Columbia on or after the 1st November.</p>

<p class="right">“(Signed) <span class="smcap">Warner R. Spalding</span>, <i>Postmaster-General</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The new postage stamp mentioned in the above is obviously the Three Pence,
blue, with large fancy letter “v” and Crown in the centre, which is catalogued by
M. Moens as issued on the 20th June, 1861, the date, we have seen, the provisional
Three Penny stamp came into use. Like that provisional, I think it is possible
the Three Pence, blue, may also have been divided to prepay the one penny
newspaper rate; but future research will, I hope, definitely determine in each
instance whether or not such was the case.</p>

<p>The following list of Post-offices, with the names of the Postmasters, was
published in <i>The Gazette</i>, for April 14th, 1866. The list is chiefly interesting as
showing upon what a small scale the Postal Service of the country then was, as at
that time there were only sixteen Post-offices opened throughout the whole colony.</p>

</div>

<p>On March 20th, 1867, an Act was passed which changed the currency of the
colony to the decimal system of cents and dollars. On March 13th, in the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
year, a new Postal Ordinance Act also became law. The following clauses are taken
from the latter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“IX. That on every Letter deposited in, or passing through, any Post-office
in the Colony, and not exceeding half an ounce in weight, there shall be paid
a postage according to the following scale; that is to say:</p>

<table summary="Postage rates">
  <tr>
    <td>At or between Victoria, or any Post-office in Vancouver Island
    and New Westminster, or any Port in the Colony</td>
    <td class="tdb">5 Cents.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Between Vancouver Island or New Westminster and Clinton or
    Savana’s Ferry</td>
    <td class="tdb">12½ Cents.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Beyond those distances</td>
    <td class="tdb">25 Cents.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Between any two Post-offices above Yale, Hope, and Douglas</td>
    <td class="tdb">12½ Cents.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>And for every additional half an ounce, or fraction of half an ounce beyond
the above weight, there shall be paid on each such Letter an additional postage,
according to the foregoing rates.</p>

<p>“X. That for every single Newspaper deposited in or passing through
any Post-office in the Colony, there shall be paid a postage of Two Cents.”</p>

</div>

<p>I have been unable to find any notice in <i>The Gazette</i> of the issue of stamps
surcharged with the value in cents, but they probably came into use at the time the
above Act was passed, or shortly afterwards. In <i>The Gazette</i> for January 18th,
1868, there is a notice giving certain Postal rates in cents, and stating that “letters,
papers, &amp;c., for Great Britain, Canada, the United States, Prince Edward Island,
and Newfoundland, must be prepaid in the Postage Stamps of the colony.” So it
is evident, from the plural word used, the <i>Cents</i> stamps were then in use. This set,
as we know, consisted of the following values: 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 cents and 1 dollar.
It is possible all the values may not have appeared at once, but they are usually
catalogued as one issue. As we see from Clause X. of the Postal Ordinance 1867 Act,
the Two Cents value prepaid newspapers alone, which accounts for the stamp being
so rarely met with postmarked. Looking at the list of letter rates in Clause IX.,
we should expect to find a Twelve and a Half Cents stamp, but, as we know, no such
value was issued. Here again I can only suggest that the Twenty-five Cents may have
been divided, or the Five Cents cut in two, and used in conjunction with a Ten
Cents or two Five Cent stamps to make up the required rate. The stamps of
British Columbia were withdrawn from use on July 20th, 1871, on the admittance
of the colony into the Dominion of Canada. Mr. N. Shakespeare is the present
Postmaster of Victoria.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—No postmarked copy of the imperforate variety is known to the
Society. The perforated stamp, although bearing the face value of Two Pence
Halfpenny, was sold at Three Pence, and did duty provisionally for this latter

<p><i>One value.</i> Engraved and type-printed by Messrs. De La Rue and Co. on white
slightly-surfaced paper, watermarked Crown and CC; white gum; machine
perforated 14. The sheet is composed of 240 stamps, divided into four panes, each
containing sixty stamps, arranged in six horizontal rows of ten. Design: Ornamental
letter “v,” representing “Victoria,” with heraldic rose inside, thistle on the left, and
sprig of shamrock on the right, surmounted by Gothic crown; is enclosed within a
white oval band, inscribed “<span class="allsmcap">BRITISH COLUMBIA POSTAGE</span>” above and “<span class="allsmcap">THREE

<h3>PRELIMINARY NOTES.</h3>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">By E. D. BACON.</span></i></p>

<p>Canada is said to have been discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497, but this
is not certain. In 1525 the French took possession of the country in the name
of the king of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so
naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence’s Day.</p>

<p>In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. The town succumbed to
the British forces under General Wolfe, and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada
was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris.</p>

<p>In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed dividing Canada into two Provinces,
Upper Canada (now Ontario) and Lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a
constitution for each. The provinces were afterwards re-united in 1840.</p>

<h3>THE DOMINION OF CANADA.</h3>

<p>The Provinces of Ontario and Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of
Canada), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, were by “The British North American
Act, 1867,” formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force by Royal
Proclamation, bearing date the 27th of May, 1867. On the 15th of July, 1870,
the newly-formed province of Manitoba; on the 20th of July, 1871, the colony of
British Columbia; and on the 1st of July, 1873, that of Prince Edward Island,
were successively admitted to the Dominion, Newfoundland now alone, of all the
North American Colonies, retaining its independence.</p>

<p>As far as I have been able to discover, Post-office notices relating to the issue
of stamps were not published in <i>The Canada Gazette</i> with other official matter.
The number of <i>The Gazette</i> for March 8th, 1851, contains a long notice, stating
that on April 5th following the management of the Inland Posts would be transferred
to the control of the Provincial Government, and that the new rates of
postage would then come into force. We learn from the report of the Postmaster-General
of Great Britain for 1857 what those rates were; for we read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In 1851 a reduced rate of postage was established. Payment in advance
is optional.</p>

<table summary="Reduced rate of postage in 1851">
  <tr>
    <td>On ordinary Letters</td>
    <td class="tdb">per ½ oz., 3d.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>On Letters posted and delivered in the same town</td>
    <td class="tdb">each, ½d.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>“Newspapers are conveyed free.</p>

<p>“Books are charged ½d. per oz., the weight of a single Packet being
limited to 4 lbs.”</p>

</div>

<p>I should add, the local rate of ½d. did not come into use until 1857. In giving
these extracts from the Postmaster-General’s Report, I have invariably altered the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
rates to their proper currency value, as they are given in the list at “about” the
sterling equivalent.</p>

<p>The rates to England in operation on May 1st, 1856, probably earlier, were:</p>

<table summary="Rates to England in operation on May 1st, 1856">
  <tr>
    <td>Closed mail, <i>viâ</i> U.S., by British Packet,</td>
    <td>not exceeding</td>

    <td class="tdc">”</td>
    <td class="tdb">½ oz.</td>
    <td class="tdb">7½d.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>We know from the extract from the Report of the Postmaster-General of Canada
for 1851, given further on in the Society’s list, that the first stamps consisted of a
Three Penny, Six Penny, and One Shilling, and that these three values were issued
shortly after April 1st. Taking into consideration the notice I have mentioned, it
seems probable the issue took place on April 5th, 1851. I can give no new information
about any of the later issues, and I shall conclude my remarks on this
province by giving some postal statistics taken from <i>The Colonial Office List</i>, 1889,
which prove to what a huge system the Post-office establishment of the Dominion
has grown. We find, however, the present expenditure greatly exceeds the revenue,
owing, I am told, to the desire of the Government to extend postal facilities as
widely as possible. I understand some changes have been made by an Act passed
this year, one of which abolishes the privilege hitherto granted to Canadian newspapers
of free transmission by post to subscribers from the publishing office.</p>

<p>The number of letters sent in the year ending 30th June, 1887, was 74,300,000;
of post cards, 16,356,000; and of newspapers (other than those sent from the office
of publication, which are all carried free), periodicals, parcels, &amp;c., 31,160,000.
The number of newspapers sent from the office of publication was about 60,000,000;
the number of letters per head of population was 15.24; the number of offices was
7,534; the revenue for 1887 was $2,603,255, and the expenditure $3,458,100.
There is weekly mail communication with Great Britain <i>viâ</i> Quebec or Halifax, and
twice a week <i>viâ</i> New York. There is a through daily service by the Canadian-Pacific
Railway to the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>The present rates of postage are as follows:</p>

<p><i>Three values.</i> Engraved and printed in <i>taille-douce</i> by Messrs. Rawdon,

Designs: <span class="smcap">Ten Pence</span>.—Profile bust portrait of Jacques Cartier to right, on ground

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—Two <i>soi-disant</i> provisionals have been chronicled; viz., the Halfpenny
surcharged in black—one with an Arabic numeral “1,” and the other with
“8d. <span class="allsmcap">STG.</span>” The Society can furnish no information concerning these two stamps;
but supposing the surcharges to be genuine, they are probably only notifications of
insufficient postage applied after the letters were posted.</p>

<p>With regard to the portrait on the Ten Pence, tradition has always assigned
it to Jacques Cartier; but in the Catalogue of the Collection of Stamps, &amp;c., in the
Museum at the Berlin Post Office, it is given as that of Sebastian Cabot. However,
as the same catalogue pronounces the portrait on the Six Pence of issue I. to be
that of Lord Elgin, it is probably equally incorrect in the former case, more
especially as a writer in <i>The Halifax Philatelist</i> for July, 1888, says “it is
identically the same as that of all the existing portraits of Jacques Cartier, and
totally unlike those existing of Sebastian Cabot.”</p>

<p>In the same article on <i>Canadian Stamps</i> in <i>The Halifax Philatelist</i> an
extract from the Postmaster-General’s Report for the year 1855 is given, showing
us the reason for the issue of the Ten Pence value. It was, “To promote the
general convenience in prepaying letters to Great Britain at the new rate, postage
stamps of the value of 10 pence currency, equal to 8 pence sterling, were procured
and issued for sale.” The same article gives the following extracts from the
Postmaster-General’s Report for 1857: “To facilitate the prepayment of letters
passing from Canada to England by the Canadian steamers, a new stamp bearing
the value of 6 pence sterling, or 7½ pence currency, being the Canadian Packet rate,
has been secured and put in circulation.” The article goes on to say, “This stamp
was rendered necessary on account of the contract between the Canadian Government
and the Allan Line of Steamers in regard to carrying the mails, and by which
contract the postage was reduced.” The other extracts read: “A new stamp has
also been introduced of the value ½ penny to serve as the medium for prepaying
transient newspapers.” “Moreover, the Department has been led by the increasing
use of postage stamps to take measures for obtaining the Canadian Postage Stamps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
on sheets perforated in the dividing line in the manner adopted in England, to
facilitate the separation of a single stamp from the others on a sheet when required
for use.”</p>

<h4>THE DOMINION OF CANADA.</h4>

<h5>Issue I. March and April, 1868.</h5>

<p><i>Seven values.</i> Engraved and printed in <i>taille-douce</i> by the British-American
Bank Note Company, of Montreal and Ottawa, on white wove paper, varying
greatly in substance, or on white laid paper; white gum; machine perforated 12.
Designs: The central design is the same in each value, and consists of a diademed
profile portrait of Queen Victoria to right, on background of horizontal lines,
enclosed within a narrow circular white line. The borders, the shape of the
labels, and the position of the numerals, vary in each value. Shapes, small
upright rectangular for the Half Cent, large upright rectangular for the other
six values. (<a href="#illus1"><i>Illustrations 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</i></a>)</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—The One Cent, yellow, on laid paper, is not known to the
Society. It is taken from <i>The Halifax Philatelist</i> for July, 1888, page 74. Some
of the stamps on wove paper have been catalogued with a watermark, consisting of
various letters. It is probable these letters are portions of the name of the
papermaker, which most likely exists in the margin of the sheets. The Half
Cent, on bluish paper, is taken from the sixth edition of M. Moens’ <i>Catalogue</i>.</p>

<h5>Issue II. 1870-1874.</h5>

<p><i>Five values</i>.—Engraved and printed in <i>taille-douce</i> by the British-American
Bank Note Company on white wove paper, varying in substance; white gum;
machine perforated 12. The entire sheets contain 100 stamps, each in ten rows
of ten. The size of the stamps and the designs are similar to that of the Half
Cent of the preceding issue, except as regards the borders of the stamps, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
differ for each value. The Six Cents was not issued until January, 1872; while
the Ten Cents did not make its appearance until the end of 1874. (<a href="#illus1"><i>Illustrations

that the Three Cents exists in very dark brown, almost black. The specimen seen
was unused, and purchased among others from the Post Office. Probably the change
in colour is due to oxidation, or some other accidental cause.</p>

<h5>Issue III. 1875-1876.</h5>

<p><i>One Value.</i> Similar in design to the stamps of the two last issues. The
stamp first appeared on October 1st, 1875, with large dimensions, like those of
Issue I.; but in March, 1876, the size was reduced to that of the stamps of
Issue II. The perforation of both varieties is 12. (<a href="#illus1"><i>Illustrations 34, 35.</i></a>)</p>

<h5>Issue V. July, 1882.</h5>

was described in the Philatelic journals of the above year as printed from a
new die, but on comparing the stamp carefully with that first issued, no alteration

<h4>REGISTRATION STAMPS.</h4>

<h5>Issue I. November 15th, 1875.</h5>

<p><i>Three values.</i> Engraved and printed in <i>taille-douce</i> by the British-American
Bank Note Co. on white wove paper; white gum; machine-perforated 12. Design:
an engine-turned <i>cartouche</i>, with scalloped edges at top and bottom, and labels, with

<p><i>Remarks</i>.—The Eight Cents was withdrawn from circulation in January, 1878.
The Five Cents imperforate is taken from <i>The Halifax Philatelist</i> for November,
1888. With regard to the much disputed Two Cents, brown, the members of the
Society think they cannot do better than reproduce here the interesting article
published in the above-mentioned paper for January, 1888, upon this stamp.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“THE CANADIAN ERROR.</p>

<p>“The Canada Two Cent brown registration, is at this time mentioned frequently
in the <i>Figaro</i> and several other philatelic publications. As there seems to be
considerable doubt as to the origin, and as I was in the main instrumental in
introducing them to the philatelic public, I have decided to give the information
I possess on this subject to them.</p>

<p>“About the beginning of January, 1887, I was shown a registered letter received
from Miscou Lighthouse Post-office, in New Brunswick. It had a <span class="allsmcap">BROWN</span> Two
Cent registration stamp on it—a clear unmistakable dark brown. I immediately
wrote the postmaster there for information relative to them. He answered and
said that he had twenty-three on hand; that he had originally received fifty
from the Post Office Department at Ottawa; and that they were <span class="allsmcap">BROWN</span> when
he received them. This he stated positively. I then sent to him for them,
but before my letter reached him he had used two of them, so that I received
only twenty-one.</p>

<p>“Those stamps I showed to several philatelists, and could not get two to
agree as to their origin. Some said the change in colour was due to the gum,
others to chemical changes, others again said it was due to the atmosphere from
the salt water. Very few would allow a misprint. In the meantime Mr. F. C.
Kaye came across another registered letter with brown registration stamp. This
time it was from the Post-office of New Ross, in Lunenburg Co., N.S. From
this office about fifty were obtained. The postmaster at this office was also
positive as to having received them from the Department at Ottawa in brown.
The same objections were raised to those as to the others, as to whether they were
genuine misprints or not. In this case the atmosphere of salt water was not the
cause, as New Ross is in the interior. If the gum was the cause of their changing
colour, it is peculiar we do not get more of them. Changes by chemical means
were also tried. The only thing which would turn the red of the genuine
colour to brown was sulphuric acid mixed with water, and this did not give a
good clear colour, having a somewhat greyish shade in it. Those experiments
have, in my opinion, confirmed their genuineness. And now as if to make
assurance in regard to their genuineness more sure, we find a third Post-office<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
with them. This was Beauly, in Antigonish Co., N.S. There were, however,
only six received from there. The postmaster had the same story as the others—he
had received them from the Department at Ottawa in a brown colour.</p>

<p>“After reading this, I do not think that any reasonable-minded person will
doubt their genuineness.</p>

<p>“The Department at Ottawa was written to in regard to them, but, as was
to be expected, knew nothing of them whatsoever. No doubt if they had been
seen they would not have been allowed to be issued to the public.</p>

<p>“We do not deny that time does change the colour in stamps, but with
those we do not think that it had anything to do. A friend of ours informed
us that in looking over a lot of old letters which he had taken out of a trunk,
and which had not been opened for several years, he found among them several
registered letters, one with the Two Cent registration stamp almost a black, all the
others having their normal colour. With due consideration and deference to better
judges than myself, I have no doubt in saying that it is my firm belief that those
Canada Two Cent, brown, registration stamps are a genuine misprint.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Donald A. King.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>The members have not had an opportunity of examining any of the specimens
referred to in Mr. King’s paper, so they are unable to give an opinion upon them.
At the same time it should be stated that copies of this stamp are frequently met
with showing traces of oxidation; some changed completely to brown or even black
in colour. It seems therefore probable that the specimens described by Mr. King
may be referred to the same category.</p>

<h4>OFFICIAL STAMP FOR RETURNED LETTERS.</h4>

<h5>1879 (?).</h5>

<p>The stamp in shape is a large oblong rectangular, printed in <i>taille-douce</i> upon
white wove paper, and perforated 12. The design consists of a straight label
of solid colour inscribed, in white block letters, “<span class="allsmcap">OFFICIALLY SEALED</span>;” above this are
the words “<span class="allsmcap">POST OFFICE CANADA</span>,” in a curved line; and below the label “<span class="allsmcap">DEAD
LETTER OFFICE</span>,” also in a curve, both inscriptions being in small coloured Roman
capitals. The rest of the design is composed of engine-turning, with ornaments of
a trefoil character in the four corners. (<a href="#illus1"><i>Illustration 38.</i></a>)</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—The only information the Society can give about this stamp is
contained in an article in <i>The Halifax Philatelist</i> for December, 1887, which is
reproduced here for the benefit of those collectors who may not have seen it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“THE ‘OFFICIALLY SEALED’ DEAD LETTER OFFICE STAMP OF CANADA.</p>

<p>“While endeavouring to afford some information about those interesting and
handsome adhesives emanating only from the Dead Letter Office at Ottawa, I regret
being unable to give all their history or chronology. What is said here the writer
has gained his knowledge by observation and experience. Doubtless there are
others who can speak of matters connected with these stamps which the writer
knows nothing of. In the first place they are scarce, very, which is to be accounted
for when we consider the manner of their use. They are never found on Local
Dead Letters, registered or unregistered. What have been seen here have all come
from the United States, and always on returned dead registered letters. I discovered
the manner of their use quite accidentally. A friend who travels in Canada for a
United States firm showed me a letter which had been returned to his address in
Michigan, and which he had posted in Canada for a Canadian address, and registered;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
and for some reason, misdirection or what not, the letter was not delivered to party
addressed—had been sent to Dead Letter Office, Ottawa, where, on being opened to
ascertain address of writer, it was resealed and adorned by Dead Letter Office Crown
Official Seal Stamp, sent to Dead Letter Office, Washington, U.S., and then sent on
registered to the writer’s address in Michigan, where he obtained it, and exhibited
it triumphantly to me.</p>

<p>“The stamp itself is a large oblong, 17 × 34, perforated, and printed in brown,
on thick white paper. Inscribed in three lines, ‘<span class="allsmcap">POST OFFICE, CANADA—OFFICIALLY
SEALED—DEAD LETTER OFFICE</span>.’</p>

are found added to the left of the stamp, and “<span class="allsmcap">HEAD QUARTERS—63RD RIFLES</span>” in
two lines lower down, to left. These surcharges are in no way official, but merely
due to private speculation.</p>

<h4>WRAPPERS.</h4>

<h5>Issue I. May, 1875, to end 1881.</h5>

<p><i>One value.</i> On light buff and yellowish-white wove unwatermarked paper.
The stamp is impressed at the right side of the wrapper, about two and a half
inches from the top. Design: Diademed profile of Queen Victoria to right upon
a background of horizontal lines, enclosed within an oval band of solid colour
contained between two white lines, the inner one of which has ornaments running
round the central oval. The band is inscribed in Roman capitals “<span class="allsmcap">CANADA POSTAGE</span>”
above, and “<span class="allsmcap">ONE CENT</span>” below. At either side, between the two inscriptions, are
small circles containing a fancy Arabic numeral of value. Above and below the
circles are conventional ornaments, and beneath the bottom ones a small Maltese
cross. Shape of stamp, an upright oval. The wrappers are gummed at the reverse
side in a straight line along the top. The gum used is brown or white in colour,
and the quantity employed varies greatly in different specimens. Two sizes of the
wrappers are known. (<a href="#illus2"><i>Illustration 41.</i></a>)</p>

<h5>Issue II. 1882.</h5>

<p><i>One value.</i> On light buff, straw, or cream-coloured wove unwatermarked
paper. Size, 11 × 5 inches, varying slightly in the dimensions. The stamp is
impressed in a similar position to that found on Issue I., and the design is a
modification of the type of that issue. The principal alterations made are found
in the circles at the sides containing the numeral of value. These have now no
ornaments at the top; while those at the bottom, with the Maltese crosses, are
replaced by other conventional ornaments of a different pattern. The central oval
of the stamp has no ornaments running round it. (<a href="#illus2"><i>Illustration 42.</i></a>)</p>

dimensions as the preceding issue. The design of the stamp is once again modified.
It is more like that found on the wrapper of Issue I., but there is no wavy line
round the interior of the oval, and the numeral of value in the circles has a white
line at either side of the figure. (<a href="#illus2"><i>Illustration 43.</i></a>)</p>

<h4>OFFICIAL WRAPPER.</h4>

<p><i>One value</i>, consisting of the wrapper of Issue I., size A, with inscription
to the left of the stamp in three lines as follows: First, “<span class="allsmcap">INLAND REVENUE,
CANADA</span>,” in fancy letters, with capital initials; second, “<span class="smcap">WEIGHTS &amp; MEASURES
SERVICE</span>,” in tall thin Roman capitals; third, “<i>Official Circular</i>,” in italic letters.
There is an ornamental wavy line between the first and second, and second and
third lines. Lower down to left is the word “<span class="allsmcap">TO</span>,” followed by two ruled straight
lines, the bottom one being somewhat shorter than the other. Beneath these lines
for the address is the following notice, “This band is to be used on Her Majesty’s
Service only, and must have no writing thereon but the name and address.”
At the top of the wrapper the equivalent French translation of the preceding
inscriptions is given. The whole of the legend is printed in blue, of a lighter
shade than the stamp. (<a href="#illus2"><i>Illustration 41.</i></a>)</p>

or blue ink. See the remarks appended to Issue III. of the envelopes.</p>

<h4>POST CARDS.</h4>

<h5>Issue I. June (?), 1871.</h5>

<p><i>One value.</i>—Designed and printed by the British-American Bank Note
Company upon light buff card; size, 4½ × 3 inches. At the top are two lines
of inscription. First, “<span class="allsmcap">CANADA POST CARD</span>,” in Roman capitals; second, “<span class="allsmcap">THE
ADDRESS ONLY TO BE WRITTEN ON THIS SIDE</span>,” in block letters. Lower down are
three ruled lines, diminishing in length, and the first is headed by the word “<span class="allsmcap">TO</span>” in
fancy script type. Between the last line and the frame at the bottom of the card,
in the centre, is “British-American Bank Note Co., Montreal and Ottawa,” in small
type. The stamp is in the right upper corner. Design: Diademed head of Queen
Victoria to right, upon ground of horizontal lines, within a dotted circle, which is
surrounded by an ornamental frame. The corners are filled in with horizontal
lines, and in the centre of each is a small trilobed figure with three balls within a
circle. At the bottom of the stamp is a straight label of solid colour, with rounded
ends, inscribed “<span class="allsmcap">ONE CENT</span>,” in Roman capitals. The card is completed by an
engine-turned frame; size, 4⅓ × 2½ inches. The inscription and the label of value
at the bottom of the stamp are in darker colour than the rest of the design. The
cards are separated on the sheet by thin coloured lines running the whole length
of the cards. (<a href="#illus2"><i>Illustration 44.</i></a>)</p>

<h5>Issue III. 1st January, 1877.</h5>

<p><i>One value.</i> Designed and printed by the British-American Bank Note
Company upon light buff card; size, 4⁷⁄₁₀ × 3 inches. The inscription is in four
lines at the top of the card. First, “<span class="allsmcap">CANADA POST CARD</span>,” in ornamental Roman
capitals, arched; second, “<span class="allsmcap">TO</span>;” third, “<span class="allsmcap">UNITED KINGDOM</span>,” in italic Roman capitals;
fourth, “<span class="allsmcap">THE ADDRESS ONLY</span>,” &amp;c., in block letters. Lower down “<span class="allsmcap">TO</span>,” in fancy
script type, and three dotted lines for the address. At the centre of the card at the
bottom, in small type, is “British-American Bank Note Co., Montreal.” The
stamp is in the right upper corner. Design: The design resembles the stamp on
Issue I., but the circle containing the head is enclosed by a plain line. The corners
are differently filled in, and the label of value is more ornamented. The frame of
the card is composed of three-quarter discs, with larger ornaments of a different
nature at the four corners; size, 1³⁄₁₀ × 2⅗ inches. (<a href="#illus2"><i>Illustration 45.</i></a>)</p>

The stamp is larger, and above and below the circle containing the head are small
arched labels of solid colour, inscribed “<span class="allsmcap">CANADA</span>” and “<span class="allsmcap">POSTCARD</span>” respectively in
Roman capitals. The label containing the value is larger, and the remainder of
the design is different. (<a href="#illus3"><i>Illustration 46.</i></a>)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">NEW BRUNSWICK.</h2>

</div>

<h3>PRELIMINARY NOTES.</h3>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">By E. D. BACON.</span></i></p>

<p>New Brunswick is situated between 45° 5′ and 48° 5′ N. lat., and 63° 47′ and
67° 53′ W. long.; its area is about 27,105 square miles. It is connected with
Nova Scotia by a low isthmus. New Brunswick, in the early part of the last century,
belonged to the French, and was called by them New France. At the peace of
1763 New Brunswick, with the rest of Canada, was ceded by France to Great
Britain, and was annexed to Nova Scotia until 1785, when it was erected into a
separate colony. It was first colonized by British subjects in 1761, and in 1783 by
disbanded troops from New England.</p>

<p>We learn from the following notice, which appeared in <i>The Royal Gazette</i>,
published at Fredericton, New Brunswick, on September 10th, 1851, that the
introduction of postage stamps into this colony took place on September 6th
of that year:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC.</p>

<p>“A <span class="allsmcap">SUPPLY</span> of <span class="allsmcap">POSTAGE STAMPS</span> has been received from England, and will be
on sale at this office on and after Friday next, the 6th September. They are
of the respective colours and values as under; viz.:</p>

<table summary="Colours and values of newly available stamps">
  <tr>
    <td><i>Scarlet</i></td>
    <td>Three Pence.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Yellow</i></td>
    <td>Six Pence.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Pink</i></td>
    <td>One Shilling.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>“Supplies will be immediately forwarded to all Postmasters throughout
the Province, and through them to the Way Office Keepers, from whom the
Public will be able to obtain them at cost prices in any quantities they may
require.</p>

<p>“N.B.—The postage stamps should be affixed to the <i>face</i>, or direction
side of the Letter, at the right hand upper corner.</p>

<p class="right">“(Signed) <span class="smcap">J. Howe</span>, <i>Postmaster-General</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">General Post Office, St. John</span>, <i>1st September, 1851</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Besides giving us the exact day the stamps came into use, the above notice is
interesting as proving which shade of the One Shilling was first issued. One
would hardly call any of the stamps of this value <i>pink</i>, as officially designated, but
the majority of them are a pinkish-mauve; and these were undoubtedly the stamps
referred to in the notice, while the darker shades of mauve, or dull violet, are those
of later printings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>The Report of the Postmaster-General of Great Britain for 1857 furnishes us
with a list of the Postal rates of the Colony in force at the time of the introduction
of postage stamps. It says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In 1842 and 1851 measures were successively introduced for the
establishment of a low rate of postage.</p>

<table summary="Lower rate of postage">
  <tr>
    <td>On Letters not exceeding ½ oz.</td>
    <td class="tdb">3d.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Above ½ oz. and not exceeding 1 oz.</td>
    <td class="tdb">6d.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">And so on, 3d. being charged for every additional ½ oz.</p>

<p>“There is an additional charge of 1d. (1½ currency?) each on Letters
delivered at St. John and Fredericton, the only places where letter carriers
are employed.</p>

<p>“Newspapers are conveyed free.</p>

<p>“On Books, &amp;c., the charge is as follows, prepayment being compulsory:</p>

<table summary="Charges for posting books">
  <tr>
    <td>For a single volume, not exceeding ½ lb. in weight</td>
    <td class="tdb">7½d.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Above ½ lb. and not exceeding 1 lb.</td>
    <td class="tdb">1s. 3d.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Above 1 lb. and not exceeding 2 lbs.</td>
    <td class="tdb">2s. 6d.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>And so on, according to the English scale of weight.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. John Howe held the position of Postmaster-General until May 30th, 1856,
when an Act came into force which made the office a political one. Mr. Francis
M’Phelim was then appointed in his place, and Mr. Howe became Postmaster of
the city of St. John on June 12th in that year. Mr. F. M’Phelim resigned office
on June 8th, 1857, and was succeeded by Mr. John Mercer Johnson, jun. The latter
resigned on November 2nd, 1858, when Mr. Charles Connell took office. Mr. Connell
resigned on May 19th, 1860, and was succeeded by Mr. James Steadman. Mr. A. S.
Phair was the Postmaster of Fredericton during these and several future years. Mr.
Stephen J. King is the present Inspector of Post-offices, and Mr. E. Willis the Postmaster
at St. John. As many collectors are aware, all three stamps of the first issue
are found cut in two, diagonally, and used for half their original values. The
Three Pence is also known cut in half, parallel to one of the sides of the stamp;
and the Six Pence exists divided into four equal triangular pieces, each part being
used as a Three Halfpenny stamp, in conjunction with a whole Six Penny, to make
up the postal rate of 7½d. I have been unable to find any official notice in
<i>The Royal Gazette</i> authorizing the use of any of these mutilated stamps; but
an interesting article, published in <i>The Philatelic Record</i> for October, 1886, clearly
shows the reason for the bisection of the Three Pence. As the article points
out, no half specimen of this value is known used by itself, but the variety
is always found obliterated in connection with other Three Pennies or a Six Penny
stamp. The paper then goes on to say the half stamp was used to make up
the letter rate to England, which was 6d. sterling the ½ ounce, equal to 7½d.
currency, or for letters forwarded <i>viâ</i> the United States and British Packet, 8d.
sterling, equal to 10d. currency. I have found out that the former rate was in
existence on May 1st, 1856, and it had probably been in use some time previous to
that date. The latter rate came into operation on January 1st, 1857. Besides the
letter rates to England, we learn from the following notice, published in <i>The Royal
Gazette</i> for September 16th, 1857, that two of the new rates on Pamphlets,
mentioned therein, could only be made up by using half the Three Penny stamp
with some of the other values.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC.</p>

<p>“On and after the first day of October next the following will be the rates
on Pamphlets sent from New Brunswick to Great Britain, <i>viâ</i> Halifax; viz.:</p>

<table summary="Postage rates for 1857">
  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>

  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>pounds, 2s. Sterling, 2s. 6d. Currency.</td>
  </tr>

<p>And so on, increasing seven pence halfpenny Currency for every additional
half pound or fraction of half pound. From the same date printed or
Lithographed Letters may be sent like other printed matter under the
Regulations of the Colonial Book Post.</p>

<p class="right">“(Signed) <span class="smcap">J. M. Johnson</span>, Jr., <i>Postmaster-General</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">General Post Office, F’ton</span>, <i>11th Sept., 1857</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>There is no stipulation that the above rates must necessarily be prepaid, and
I have no doubt from the following notice, which was published in the <i>British
Postal Guide</i> for October 1st, 1859, that correspondence between the United
Kingdom and all the North American Colonies was frequently forwarded either
wholly or only partly prepaid from both sides.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“NOVA SCOTIA, NEW BRUNSWICK, AND NEWFOUNDLAND.</p>

<p>“Letters for Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland, if posted
unpaid, or insufficiently prepaid, are now charged on delivery with a fine
of 6d. each in addition to the postage.”</p>

</div>

<p>A similar notice had previously appeared in the <i>Postal Guide</i> with reference
to Canada, and one was published later on in connection with letters for Prince
Edward Island.</p>

<p>This addition of a fine of 6d. upon unpaid or insufficiently prepaid letters
would naturally cause senders to be anxious to see their correspondence properly
stamped, and consequently a good many more cut stamps would be required after
the appearance of this notice, which no doubt was published in New Brunswick
the same as in this country. We should therefore expect to find a greater number
of half Three Pennys postmarked after October 1st, 1859, than previously to that
date. As regards the bisection of the Six Pence and One Shilling values, there
was not the same <i>raison d’être</i>; but the varieties are probably due to one or perhaps
both of these causes: (<i>a</i>) The public seeing the Three Pence was allowed to be
used in this way, may have concluded the two other stamps might be similarly
employed, and not having the value by them they required at the moment,
manufactured it out of either the Six Pence or One Shilling. (<i>b</i>) Or it may be
that certain Post-offices fell short of Three Penny and Six Penny stamps, and
issued the halves of the two higher values provisionally until a fresh supply of
the required value was obtained. Whatever was the true cause of these varieties,
whether they emanated from the public or were issued in this state by the Post-office,
they were certainly allowed by the postal officials to frank correspondence.
I can add no further information about the half Three Penny stamp surcharged
1½d., beyond that found in the article in <i>The Philatelic Record</i>, I have already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
mentioned, and the remarks in a supplementary paper in the number of that
journal for January, 1887. I entirely agree with the conclusions the writer comes
to; viz., that the authenticity of the surcharge is open to grave doubt, and that
in all probability the variety is altogether “bogus.” At the same time the author
is perhaps in error when he says the charge for delivering letters in the towns of
Fredericton and St. John in 1857 was 1d. each, and not 1½d. It is true the
Postmaster-General’s report for that year speaks of 1d. as the sum charged, but
we must bear in mind that this is probably 1d. sterling (all the other rates being
quoted in this way), which would therefore equal 1¼d. currency, and 1d. would
most likely be given in the list as the nearest equivalent for 1½d. currency. Again,
the remark “that when the cents issue took place in 1860 no stamp was issued
anywhere approaching to the value of 1½d.” is equally applicable to the value 1d.,
as the Two Cents stamp was, according to the catalogues, not issued until quite
the end of the year 1863.</p>

<p>The annexed notice is found in <i>The Royal Gazette</i> for August 3rd, 1859:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Post Office Department, Fredericton</span>, <i>6th July, 1859</i>.</p>

<p>“Part 9, Section 2, of Post Office Regulations is repealed, and the following
adopted; viz.:</p>

<p>“Printed Books, Periodical Publications or Pamphlets, under sixteen
ounces in weight, can be forwarded by Post in New Brunswick at the rate
of one half penny per ounce.</p>

<p>“Printed Music will be allowed to pass through Post in New Brunswick
under the same Regulations as Pamphlets.</p>

<p>“Printed Circulars, Catalogues, Hand Bills, and Prices Current posted
in New Brunswick will be liable to a rate of one half penny each, subject
to the following Regulations; viz.:</p>

<p>“The Postage must be prepaid.</p>

<p>“Each must be in a Cover unsealed, or if sealed, open at the end or
side; the word ‘Circular,’ ‘Catalogue,’ ‘Hand Bill,’ or ‘Price Current,’ as the
case may be, must be written or printed on the face of the Cover; and each
Package must weigh under half an ounce.</p>

<p>“Any of the above mentioned, however, coming into New Brunswick
by Post from the United States, Canada, Nova Scotia, or Prince Edward
Island, will be subject to one half penny Postage, to be collected on delivery,
and must be taxed accordingly.</p>

<p class="right">“(Signed) <span class="smcap">Charles Connell, P.M.G.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>The postage on the above must, I think, have been prepaid in money until
the issue of the One Cent stamp in May, 1860; for it is difficult to see how a
halfpenny value could have been improvised out of the three stamps then current.</p>

<p>From the following notice, taken from <i>The Royal Gazette</i> for January 19th, 1859,
it will be seen New Brunswick was one of the first, perhaps the earliest colony, to
start a Parcels Post.</p>

upon the formation of the Dominion of Canada.</p>

<h3>REFERENCE LIST OF THE PHILATELIC SOCIETY, LONDON.</h3>

<h4>Issue I. September 6th, 1851.</h4>

<p><i>Three values.</i> Engraved and printed in <i>taille-douce</i> by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon,
and Co., of London, on stoutish blue wove paper, varying in colour from deep
to pale blue; yellowish gum, imperforate. Design: In the centre, in an octagonal-shaped
<i>cartouche</i>, with engine-turned border, is the Royal Crown. Above, below,
and on either side, is an eight-rayed star, containing the heraldic flowers of the
United Kingdom. The upper and lower have the rose, that on the left the
shamrock, and that on the right the thistle, the rose in the lower star being
inverted. A curved white line surrounds the stars, the angles formed by which are
filled in with floral ornaments; engine-turned background. Reticulated side labels,
inscribed with name of Colony in plain Roman capitals; “<span class="allsmcap">POSTAGE</span>” in plain block
letters, and the value in various type. That on the Three Pence is in plain Roman
capitals, and in block letters on the other two values. In the Six Pence both
the word “<span class="allsmcap">POSTAGE</span>” and the value show a line of colour down the centre of each
letter. Plain lozenge in each corner of the stamp, with coloured Arabic numeral of
value. Shape, lozenge. (<a href="#illus4"><i>Illustrations 49, 50, 51.</i></a>)</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Varieties.</i>—The Three Pence exists upon white paper, but the variety is only
due to the discharge of the blue colouring matter from the paper, as the stamp was
never printed upon white. Each of the values is met with cut in two, and used as
half the value of the stamp so mutilated. The Six Pence is also known divided
into four triangular pieces, each quarter being used, in conjunction with a whole
Six Pence, to make up the postal rate of 7½d. These bisected stamps were used to
prepay the postage rate to the United Kingdom, which in 1857 was reduced to
7½d.; and as there was no stamp of this value in use, recourse had to be made to
these varieties. The Three Pence has been seen divided obliquely, and surcharged
in red “1½.” The same surcharge is also said to exist in black. Neither of these
two stamps has come under the notice of the Society; but from certain remarks
contained in two articles, which may be found in <i>The Philatelic Record</i>, vol. viii.
pp. 165 and 219, there can be little doubt that the surcharge is “bogus.”</p>

<h4>Issue II. May 15th, 1860.</h4>

<p><i>Five values.</i> Engraved and printed in <i>taille-douce</i> by the American Bank Note
Company, of New York, on white wove paper; brownish gum; machine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
perforated 12. The entire sheet of each value contains 100 stamps, arranged
in ten rows of ten. There is no engraver’s name found on the margins of the
sheets of the four lowest values, but the Seventeen Cents has “American Bank
Note Co., New York,” on the edges of the sheet. This value and the Five Cents
were not issued until after the other three stamps. Designs: <span class="smcap">One Cent.</span>—Railway
train, within transverse coloured oval band inscribed in white Roman capitals.
Small slanting ovals in the upper, and larger upright ovals in the lower corners, with
white Arabic numeral of value. Curved octagonal label below, with “<span class="allsmcap">CENT</span>” in
white Roman capitals. The remainder of the stamp is filled in with fine hatched
lines, with border of two plain coloured lines. <span class="smcap">Five Cents.</span>—Diademed, nearly
full-face portrait, of Queen Victoria looking to left, on ground of horizontal lines,
within an upright coloured oval, lettered in white Roman capitals. Small slanting
ovals in the upper, and larger upright ones in the lower corners, with white Arabic
numerals of value. Oblong octagonal label below, with “<span class="allsmcap">CENTS</span>” in white Roman
capitals. The spandrels are filled in with hatched lines, and two outer lines of
colour complete the design. <span class="smcap">Ten Cents.</span>—Similar to last, but small slanting ovals
in the spandrels, with Roman numeral in white. The bottom corners of the stamp

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—The reason the Five Cents was not issued at the same time as the
One, Ten, and Twelve and a Half Cents stamps was, that Mr. Charles Connell, who
was Postmaster-General of the Colony at that time, had ordered his own portrait to
be engraved upon this value. It will be seen from the interesting correspondence
Mr. King gives in <i>The Halifax Philatelist</i> for June, July, and August, 1888, which
is reproduced here, that the Council disapproved of the design, and refused to allow
the stamps to be distributed. Mr. Connell was ordered at the same time to obtain
a fresh supply of Five Cents stamps with the head of Her Majesty. The Connell
Five Cents can therefore only be looked upon as a stamp prepared for use, notwithstanding
postmarked copies are known, as it is quite clear from Mr. King’s article
the stamp was never issued to the public. In design, it is almost similar to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Ten Cents, but the head of Her Majesty is replaced by a full face portrait of
Charles Connell, and the numerals in the spandrels are Arabic, instead of Roman in
type. The stamp was produced by the American Bank Note Company, of New
York, printed in Vandyke-brown upon white wove paper, and perforated 12.
Imperforate copies exist, but these can be looked upon only as proofs.

<p class="center">“A PHILATELIC CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF NEW BRUNSWICK.</p>

<p class="center">“THE CONNELL STAMP.</p>

<p>“This stamp has probably been discussed more than any other stamp, or
series of stamps, that have ever been issued, and still a decision has never been
arrived at as to whether they are essays or whether any have ever done postal
duty. The general opinion seems to be that they were in use, but only for a day.
The way the stamp originated was this: Mr. Connell, then Postmaster-General
of New Brunswick, was authorised by a Minute of Council in December, 1859,
to procure a new set of postage stamps, which the change in currency rendered
necessary. Believing that this Minute gave him full power and discretion as to
designs, etc., he ordered the plates for the values wanted—One, Five, Ten, and
Twelve and a Half Cents; and for the Five Cents had his own portrait. The
stamps came to hand in due time, and Mr. Connell, not probably making any secret
of the design for the Five Cents, spoke to some of his friends about them, and of his
intention of going down to posterity thereon. This came to the knowledge of the
Council, who, knowing that they had not been approved by them, decided to see
the issue before it was sent out to postmasters for public use. As a matter of
course they disapproved of Mr. Connell’s design for the Five Cents, and he was
instructed by the Council to destroy them, and order a new lot with the effigy of
the Queen. This Mr. Connell would not do, and therefore resigned. The Five
Cents, brown, were destroyed, and only the other three values issued.</p>

<p>“After Mr. Connell’s resignation, he wrote a letter to the Hon. J. H. T.
Manners-Sutton, the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province, giving his reasons
for resigning his office. He, however, says that he did not resign on account
of the stamp affair, but because he could not agree with the Government expenditure
of public moneys, and because he said that his colleagues did not have
confidence enough in him to back him up on a small matter; that is, the issuing
of the Five Cents, brown. Through the kindness of a friend I have been enabled to
see the complete official correspondence, etc., between Connell, the Governor, and
Council in reference to this business, and am giving them here. Several of the
letters contain a large amount of matter irrelevant to the subject in question, and
dealing only with the political reasons of Mr. Connell’s resignation, and these
parts not being interesting to the philatelic reader are left out.</p>

<p>“The correspondence starts with the letter of the Council to the Lieutenant-Governor
after they had had the designs submitted to them.</p>

<p class="noindent">“‘<i>To His Excellency The Hon. J. H. T. Manners-Sutton, Lt.-Gov., &amp;c., &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—The Royal Gazette of the 6th inst. contains a memorandum intended
as a reply to my letter of the 30th ult. to your Excellency, in which your
advisers exhibit a great anxiety to impress on the mind of your Excellency that
the only cause of my resignation of the office of Postmaster-General was the
refusal of the Council to advise your Excellency to order the issue of the Five Cent
stamps. I have in my previous letters to your Excellency stated some of the
many reasons forming the basis of my conclusion to resign, and to repeat that
I was not influenced in my course altogether by the stamp question I consider
unnecessary, that matter merely having had the effect of bringing my previous
intention to its fulfilment, for sooner or later my resignation must have been
tendered. I will however say, that the usage I did receive at the hands of my
colleagues, in reference to the stamps, would have been sufficient to cause such
action as I took upon the premises.</p>

<p>“‘The correspondence between myself and the Provincial Secretary, with
reference to the issue of the Postage Stamps, laid before your Excellency, either
has not had a careful perusal, or else they are in ignorance of the meaning
conveyed by such correspondence.</p>

<p>“‘I was first authorized to procure the stamps, and stated on the floor of
the House in March last that ‘I had ordered, and would receive in time for
distribution on the 1st of May, stamps of the denomination of One, Five, Ten,
and Twelve and a Half Cent, in view of the introduction of the decimal system
of currency.’ They arrived, and preparations for their issue at the appointed time
were made by the Department, supposing that any further orders were unnecessary,
until I received the telegram from the Provincial Secretary, and subsequent
interference on the parts of your advisers, in what was a mere matter of detail,
became apparent. An order to issue all but Five Cent stamps was made, thus
setting aside my power and right to conduct even a minor arrangement of the
Department. After having procured, by the knowledge and consent of the
Government, stamps of various denominations, my position as head of a department
was ignored. Even if this was the only circumstance influencing me, my
course was the only honourable one to pursue.</p>

<p>“‘I have the honour to be,</p>

<p class="center">“‘Your Excellency’s most obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Charles Connell</span>.’</p>

</div>

<p>“This finishes this most remarkable correspondence and chapter in the postal
history of New Brunswick.</p>

<p>“A careful reading and consideration of the letters here given will show
the impossibility of there ever having been any of the Connell stamps used to
pay the postage of a letter, although an inference to the contrary may be drawn
from Nos. 5 and 9, being the letters of the Executive Council, but this is due
I think to loose writing, or probably meaning that they were in the hands of the
Post Office Department for distribution. Against this we see the telegrams to
Connell forbidding the issue, three days before they were to start sending them
to postmasters, and his telegram to Hale, the Secretary of the Post Office Department
of N. B., at Fredericton, forbidding him to send out any of the stamps. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
my opinion the Connell is undoubtedly not a postage stamp, but a rare essay only.
As a fitting end to this I may add the official account of the money paid for the
making of the Cent issue of New Brunswick.</p>

<h3>PRELIMINARY NOTES.</h3>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">By E. D. BACON.</span></i></p>

<p>Newfoundland is an island situated between 46° 37′ and 51° 39′ N. lat., and
52° 35′ and 59° 25′ W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
The greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130;
its estimated area is 40,200 square miles. The coast of Labrador, on the Continent,
is now included in the Colony. It comprises about 120,000 square miles, but
has only 4211 inhabitants. The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497. It
was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its
fisheries. Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
attempted to colonize this island, but were not successful. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert,
afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the south-east part of the island,
and appointed his son Governor. In 1634, a party of colonists were sent over from
Ireland, and twenty years after some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by
means of a Parliamentary grant. At the peace of Utrecht, in 1713, subsequently
ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was ceded
to Great Britain, subject to certain rights reserved to France, which are still in
question between the two nations. As already mentioned, Newfoundland is now (1889)
the only North American Colony not included within the Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p>Newfoundland has never possessed an Official Gazette, but Government notices
appear in the newspaper <i>The Royal Gazette and Newfoundland Advertiser</i>, published
at St. John’s. The earliest file of this newspaper, with the exception of one or
two odd numbers, I have found in this country commences with the year 1875, so
I have been unable to gain any particulars about the stamps of this Colony from
that source. The Report of the Postmaster-General of Great Britain for 1857 I
have before quoted from tells us:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Inland Posts were established in 1852. In 1853 a reduced and uniform
rate of postage for Letters was established, and another for Books.</p>

<table summary="Rates of postage for 1857">
  <tr>
    <td>On Letters not exceeding ½ oz.</td>
    <td class="tdb">3d.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exceeding ½ oz. and not exceeding 1 oz.</td>
    <td class="tdb">6d.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Above 1 oz. <span class="ditto2">”</span> <span class="ditto2">”</span> 1½ oz.</td>
    <td class="tdb">9d.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">And so on in proportion.</p>

<p>“Newspapers are conveyed free.</p>

<p>“On Books the postage is about 2d. per oz. up to 6 ozs., exceeding that
weight, 3d. per oz. up to 16 ozs., beyond which weight they cannot be transmitted
through the post.”</p>

</div>

<p>Postage stamps are not mentioned, so they had evidently not been introduced
into the Colony at the time the above particulars were sent over; but 1857 is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
year usually given as that in which the first issue took place. The present rates
of postage are as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. John Delaney was Postmaster-General of the Colony in 1879, and
Mr. J. O. Fraser holds that office at the present time.</p>

<p>I regret, as in the case of Canada, I am unable to give you copies of any of
the official notices of the issue of the stamps of this Colony. I hope, however,
I may shortly be followed by other writers, who may have greater facilities, and be
more successful in obtaining the desired information than I have been.</p>

<h3>REFERENCE LIST OF THE PHILATELIC SOCIETY, LONDON.</h3>

<h4>Issue I. 1857.</h4>

<p><i>Seven values.</i> Engraved and printed in <i>taille-douce</i> by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon,
and Co., of London, on stoutish white wove paper; yellowish gum, imperforate.
Designs: The design of the <span class="smcap">One Penny</span> and <span class="smcap">Five Pence</span> closely resembles that of
the first issue of New Brunswick, except that the crown in the centre is printed
straight instead of obliquely, and that there is a small oblong white label above
that containing the value, inscribed “<span class="allsmcap">POSTAGE</span>” in small coloured block letters.
Numerals of value on white squares in each corner. Shape, square. <span class="smcap">Three Pence.</span>—Heraldic
flowers on a trilobed <i>cartouche</i> in centre, on reticulated background.
Labels of solid colour at left, right, and at the bottom, inscribed in white Roman
capitals. Lozenge-shaped blocks in the three corners, with coloured Arabic numeral
of value in small white circles. Shape, triangular. The <span class="smcap">Two Pence</span>, <span class="smcap">Four Pence</span>,
<span class="smcap">Six Pence</span>, and <span class="smcap">One Shilling</span> are very similar in design, which consists of a bunch
of heraldic flowers in a central circle on the Two Pence, Four Pence, and One
Shilling, and in an oval on the Six Pence. The central circle, or oval, is enframed
in a larger engine-turned oval, inscribed above with name of Colony in a curve of
white block letters. The remainder of the design varies in detail for each value;
but all have the value in full in the bottom label, and Arabic numerals of value
in the corners. Shape, upright rectangular. (<a href="#illus4"><i>Illustrations 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64.</i></a>)</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—A specimen of the One Penny in the Vice-President’s collection
is pin-perforated, but no information is available as to the authenticity of this
stamp. Two sets may be made of the One Penny, Three Pence, and Five Pence.
The first is found on fairly thick white wove paper, and the second on paper which
is thinner and more transparent. A close examination will also show that the two
papers are quite different in texture. The paler shades of the One Penny and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Five Pence, which appeared in 1863, are found on the thinner paper. All three
values are appreciably smaller in size than those printed on the thicker paper, but
whether this is due to shrinkage of the paper, or to the engraving of a new plate,
is doubtful. The same shade of green was used for the Three Pence in both sets.
M. Moens catalogues the Six Pence Halfpenny and Eight Pence as issued with this
set; but these two values are not known to the Society as existing in the early
shade of orange. The stamps of this series printed in orange, and those of
the next set, are frequently met with with the colour changed to brown or even
black. These varieties are simply due to oxidation.</p>

<h4>Issue II. 1860(?).</h4>

<p><i>Six values.</i> Consisting of the Two Pence, Four Pence, Six Pence, and the
One Shilling of the preceding issue, with two new values of Six Pence Halfpenny
and Eight Pence added. The central designs of these two latter are similar to those
of the other stamps, but the minor details vary. The colour of the four first stamps
is changed from orange to scarlet-vermilion. (<a href="#illus4"><i>Illustrations 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66.</i></a>)</p>

<p><i>Six values.</i> Engraved and printed in <i>taille-douce</i> by the American Bank
Note Co., of New York, on yellowish and white wove paper; machine-perforated.
The sheet of the Two Cents (the only one seen by the Society) contains one
hundred stamps in ten rows of ten. Designs:</p>

circles break the oval at each corner, and contain the Arabic numeral of
value on coloured ground.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—The latter variety is taken from <i>The Halifax Philatelist</i> for July,

seen perforated 14, but no explanation is forthcoming of a kind of mystery which
appears to overhang these specimens. There is some doubt as to their authenticity.</p>

<h4>Issue V. 1868-70.</h4>

<p><i>Four values.</i> Engraved and printed in <i>taille-douce</i>, by the American Bank
Note Co., of New York, on white wove paper; machine perforated. Designs:
<span class="smcap">One Cent</span>. Three-quarter-face portrait of the Prince of Wales in Highland
costume, looking to the right, on ground of wavy lines, within a shaded oval
frame inscribed below “<span class="allsmcap">NEWFOUNDLAND</span>” in white Roman capitals, and above
with the letters “<span class="allsmcap">N. F.</span>” Over the upper portion of the oval is a scroll with value
in full in white Roman capitals, Arabic numeral of value in the two bottom
corners. <span class="smcap">Three</span> and <span class="smcap">Six Cents</span>. Profile bust portrait of Queen Victoria to right
in widow’s weeds, on shaded background of horizontal lines within an arched
frame. Two curved labels above, inscribed respectively “<span class="allsmcap">THREE</span>” (“<span class="allsmcap">SIX</span>”) and
“<span class="allsmcap">NEWFOUNDLAND</span>.” Curved label below with value in full, all in white Roman
capitals. Scroll ornaments in each corner, the upper ones containing Arabic
numerals of value and the lower ones small five-rayed stars. Shape: Upright

notice of the Society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>It is somewhat peculiar that after issuing a stamp in 1866 with portrait
of the Prince of Wales arrived at manhood, another should have been issued nearly
three years later representing him as a little boy.</p>

<h4>Issue VI. 1871-1873.</h4>

<p><i>Two values.</i> In May, 1871, a new die was engraved for the One Cent of 1868.
The chief alterations noticeable are in the face of the Prince of Wales, and the
letters “<span class="allsmcap">N. F.</span>,” which are closer to the scroll. On April 1st, 1873, the Three Cents
of the last issue appeared with its colour changed to blue. The perforation of both
stamps is 12. (<a href="#illus4"><i>Illustrations 75, 74.</i></a>)</p>

Bank Note Company, of Montreal, on white wove paper; machine-perforated 12.
The entire sheet of each value contains 100 stamps, arranged in ten rows of ten.
These stamps are coarse imitations of those printed by the American Bank Note
Company. Designs: <span class="smcap">One Cent</span>.—Three-quarter face portrait of the Prince of
Wales in Highland costume looking to right, on ground of horizontal lines, within
inscribed oval. Ornamented circles in the upper corners, lettered respectively

inscribed in white Roman capitals. Circles in lower corners with numerals of
value; ornamental border. Shapes, upright rectangular for the One and Three
Cents, oblong rectangular for the other two values. (<a href="#illus4"><i>Illustrations 76, 77, 78, 79.</i></a>)</p>

<p><i>Six values.</i> Engraved and printed in <i>taille-douce</i> by the British-American
Bank Note Co., of Montreal, on white wove paper; yellowish gum; machine-perforated
12. The entire sheet of the Ten Cents contains fifty stamps, arranged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
in five vertical rows of ten; while those of the other five values are composed of
one hundred stamps each, in ten rows of ten. Designs: <span class="smcap">Half Cent</span>.—A plain
upright shield, with ground of horizontal lines, shaded at either side; bears in the
centre, the head of a Newfoundland dog enclosed within a pearled circle, surrounded
by a circular band of solid colour, inscribed in white Roman capitals with the name
of the Colony at the top, and the value “<span class="allsmcap">HALF CENT</span>” at the bottom, the two last
words being separated by a small upright tablet, with rounded top and pearl border,
containing “½” in white Arabic numerals. <span class="smcap">Ten Cents.</span>—Brig in full sail, to right;
curved label of solid colour above, inscribed with the name of the Colony; similar
straight label below with the value in full, both inscriptions being in white Roman

solid colour, with Arabic numerals of value at each side of the stamp. Scroll-like
ornaments complete the design, which is evidently copied to some extent from the
Thirteen Cents of Issue IV. The One Cent, Two, Three, and Five Cents are the
same designs as the preceding issue, but with the colours changed. Shapes: Small
square for the Half Cent, upright rectangular for the One and Three Cents, oblong

<h2 class="nobreak">NOVA SCOTIA.</h2>

</div>

<h3>PRELIMINARY NOTES.</h3>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">By E. D. BACON.</span></i></p>

<p>Nova Scotia is a peninsula between 43° 46′ N. lat., and 61° 67′ W. long.,
connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide. Its
length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much
variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Canso, forms
part of the province. It contains an area of 20,907 square miles, about one-fifth
part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea.</p>

<p>Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonized by the
French in 1598, who gave it the name of <i>Acadia</i>. It was taken by the English,
and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander by James I. in 1627; and it was this
monarch who altered the name to Nova Scotia. In 1632 it was restored to France,
with Quebec, by the Treaty of <i>St. Germain-en-Laye</i>, but again ceded to England at
the Peace of Utrecht, in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a
settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city
which now bears his name is the capital of the province. Cape Breton was not
finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate
Colony.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mr. Donald A. King’s persevering assiduity in hunting up official
notices, and other particulars connected with the stamps of this Colony, we have
from him what may be considered almost a complete history of their introduction
and use. His papers are most interesting and valuable, as they elucidate many
previously obscure points in regard to these stamps, and I think the Society has
acted wisely in republishing them as they originally appeared in <i>The Halifax
Philatelist</i>. Amongst other information Mr. King gives from the Report of the
Postmaster-General of Nova Scotia for the year 1852 occurs this sentence: “Postage
stamps valued at One Shilling, Six Pence, and Three Pence have been procured
from Trelayney Saunders, Esq., stationer, of London.” Trelawney (as the name
should be spelt) Saunders is given in Kelly’s <i>Post Office London Directory</i> of 1851
as a “mapseller, publisher, and stationer, agent by appointment for the ordnance
maps and admiralty charts,” &amp;c. &amp;c.; and his address was 6, Charing Cross. He
it was who evidently received the order from the Colony for a supply of postage
stamps, which he must have entrusted to Messrs. Perkins, Bacon, and Co. to carry
out, as it was this latter firm who engraved the stamps.</p>

<p>Mr. King gives an extract from one of the Reports, which authorizes the
bisection of the Three Pence to allow the prepayment of the 7½d. rate to England;
but the Report states distinctly the Three Penny stamp was alone to be used for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
that purpose. As in the case of New Brunswick, both the Six Pence and One
Shilling are found bisected. The Nova Scotia varieties are probably due to the
same causes as those I have given for the former Colony. The following particulars
found in the Report of the Postmaster-General of Great Britain, published in 1857,
will give us the early postal rates of Nova Scotia:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In 1842, ’51, ’53, ’54, and ’56 measures were successively adopted for the
establishment of a low rate of postage.</p>

<table summary="Lower rate of postage">

  <tr>

    <td class="tdb">9d.</td>

</table>

<p class="noindent">And so on in proportion.</p>

<p>“Letters posted and delivered in the same town are charged 1d. only per ½ oz.</p>

<p>“Newspapers are conveyed free.</p>

<p>“On printed Circulars, Prices Current, Handbills, &amp;c., the postage is

Book privilege is limited), the postage is ½d. per oz.”</p>

<p>The present Inspector of Post-offices is Mr. C. J. Macdonald, and the
Postmaster at Halifax Mr. H. W. Blackader. The stamps of this Colony became
obsolete on May 27th, 1867, the date of the formation of the Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p>Before giving a detailed list of the stamps of Nova Scotia, the Society thinks
it would be advisable to reproduce here the excellent articles upon the stamps of
this Colony from the pen of Mr. Donald A. King, which were published in
<i>The Halifax Philatelist</i> for December, 1887, January and December, 1888.
Most of the information Mr. King gives is entirely new to collectors, and he
traces back the date of the first issue from 1857, the year it has previously been
put down at in the catalogues, to September 1st, 1851.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“ISSUING OF THE FIRST POSTAGE STAMPS IN NOVA SCOTIA.</p>

<p>“In looking over any of the standard stamp catalogues, the reader will see that
the date for the issue of postage stamps in Nova Scotia is 1857, and New Brunswick
in 1851. It always seemed to me as very peculiar, considering the nearness of the
two countries and the resemblance in their Governments, that Nova Scotia should
be so long behind New Brunswick in issuing stamps.</p>

<p>“I determined to turn the matter up on the first possible occasion, and see if
the dates were in reality correct.</p>

<p>“On enquiring at the Provincial Secretary’s office in Halifax, I found that all
records of the Nova Scotian Post Office Department had, at the confederation
of the British North American provinces, been transferred to Ottawa. However,
through the kindness of the Hon. W. S. Fielding, the Provincial Secretary, I found
in the legislative library the yearly reports of the Postmaster-General of the
province for the years previous to confederation. Starting with 1857—the supposed
date of issue—I found that postage stamps were regularly mentioned in all parts of
the Departmental accounts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“It was the same in 1856, 1855, and 1854. A person would imagine from the
way the accounts read that stamps had been used for twenty years previous.</p>

<p>“In the Reports dated January 7th, 1854 (being the work for 1853), I found
an item of information which is not given in any catalogue. It is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">One Penny</span> postage stamps having recently been received from London and
put into circulation are now to be had in nearly every Post-office in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>“‘There are at present stamps for One Shilling, Six Pence, Three Pence, and
One Penny; and the public have thus every facility afforded them to prepay their
letters to any place to which stamps can free them. His Excellency’s Government
having at considerable outlay introduced into the country the system of prepayment
by stamps, it is a subject of gratulation that the public at large are beginning to feel
and appreciate their convenience and advantages, a much larger amount having
been issued from my office during the past than the previous year, being an
increase of over 25 per cent., as will be seen by reference to Report I.’</p>

</div>

<p>“Thus finding that the One Penny had not been issued till some time after
the other values were, I then turned to the Report dated January 2nd, 1853 (being
the report for the year 1852), in which he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Postage stamps valued at One Shilling, Six Pence, and Three Pence have
been procured from Trelayney Saunders, Esq., stationer, of London, and supplied to
stationers, postmasters, merchants, and others at a discount of 5 per cent. allowed
on sums of £5 and upwards. During the past year there have been issued from
my office postage stamps to the value of £355 2s. 6d. This is a much smaller
circulation than was anticipated at the time of their introduction into the
provinces, the public generally, I apprehend, not yet clearly understanding their
use, nor appreciating their advantages.</p>

<p>“‘They are deposited with the Receiver-General for safe keeping, from whom
I procure them when a supply is needed. Application has been made for One
Penny stamps, which are expected to arrive shortly.’</p>

</div>

<p>“Then taking the Report for January 5th, 1852, I find among the accounts
of the Post Office Department for the quarter ending the 5th January, 1852,
the following issues:</p>

<p>“These extracts from Postmaster General’s Reports and from Post Office
Department Accounts will positively decide the question as to date of issue.</p>

<p>“The Three Penny, Six Penny, and One Shilling were, I should think, issued
to the public in the second quarter of 1851; and the One Penny were probably put
out about the last part of 1853.</p>

<p>“In the same Reports I also found the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘To remedy to some extent the serious inconvenience said to be experienced
by merchants and others in consequence of there being no Seven and One Halfpenny
currency postage stamp, by which parties who feel desirous could thus
prepay their letters to England, and not wishing to put the province to any
further expense in having another ‘die’ prepared, I considered it expedient to
allow half stamps to be used with those now in use, to obviate the want of
accommodation complained of; and a circular was accordingly forwarded to my
deputies, and a notice issued to the public, to the effect that letters could be
prepaid to England by stamps by parties using a Six Pence or two Three Penny
stamps together with half a Three Penny stamp. The Three Penny stamp to be
cut diagonally, and the Half to be equivalent to 1½d. The Three Penny stamp
alone to be used for that purpose.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“The Three Penny stamp I have never seen cut and used in that manner.
This order was issued after the reduction of the packet postage to England from
1 shilling to 7½ pence.</p>

<p>“Major Evans in his Catalogue mentions the Three Penny surcharged
‘<span class="allsmcap">PAID 5 CENTS</span>,’ and also overprinted ‘<span class="allsmcap">5 CENTS</span>.’ This I think can be easily
explained, as will be seen by the following: About 1854 (I think, but am not sure)
an agreement was entered into between the Postmasters-General of Nova Scotia and
the United States for the exchange of correspondence between their respective
countries. It was agreed upon that the postage should be 5 cents, the Nova
Scotian Three Penny stamp to be equal to that value.</p>

<p>“All letters going to the United States from Nova Scotia, west, to be stamped
on the face, whether they were paid or not, by the office which despatched the mail
to the United States. The stamp which was used for that purpose corresponds
in all particulars with the supposed surcharges. This stamping I have no doubt
has occasionally been done on the postage stamps, and thus those so-called surcharges
have become known.</p>

<p>“All the efforts that I made to find out who first proposed the introduction of
postage stamps in Nova Scotia were in vain. But I presume, judging from the
accounts of the Post Office Department, that the Hon. Joseph Howe was
instrumental in doing so. This indeed was an act worthy of the liberal and
enlightened mind of one of Nova Scotia’s greatest sons.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“NOVA SCOTIA STAMPS.</p>

<p>“In the December number of this paper I had an article on the proper date of
issue of the Pence stamps of Nova Scotia. In it I ventured to assert that they
were issued in the middle of 1851. Since then, on further investigation, I have
discovered the exact date of issue. The proof is obtained in the following extract
from the <i>Chronicle</i> of the 30th of August, 1851:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“‘NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC.</p>

<p>“‘Postage stamps having been received from England, notice is hereby given
that stamps of Three Pence, Six Pence, and One Shilling can be purchased at this
office on and after <i>Monday, the 1st day of September next</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Postage stamps before being used should be examined to ascertain
that they will firmly adhere (as in the event of their falling off the letters become
charged with postage), they should then be placed on the front of the letter, <i>and
upon the right hand corner of the upper side</i>. Should this direction not be attended
to, from the rapidity with which the duty must be performed, letters which bear
stamps will frequently be taxed, while the parties receiving them will be put to
much trouble in obtaining a return of the postage improperly charged.</p>

<p>“‘In all cases of complaint, whether of any irregularity, the covers of the
letters (and contents in all practicable cases) must invariably be kept and sent to
the post-office as affording the only means of investigating the complaint.</p>

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">A. Woodgate, D.P.M.G.</span></p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">General Post Office, Halifax</span>, <i>August 25th, 1851</i>.’</p>

</div>

<p>“This will, I think, settle the matter as to the proper date of issue.</p>

<p>“While on this subject it would be as well to give the same information in
regard to the Cent issue of Nova Scotia, although there is no error in regard to
the date of those as there is to the first issue. The extract following is taken from
the Report of the Postmaster-General of Nova Scotia for 1860. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Postage stamps of a new design, and adapted to the decimal system, were
obtained, with the consent of the Governor in Council, from the New York
American Bank Note Co., and circulated on the 1st of October last (1860). The
design, colour, and value of the stamps are as follows: One Cent, black; Five
Cent, blue; Eight and a Half Cent, green; Ten Cent, scarlet; and Twelve and
a Half Cent, black.</p>

<p>“‘A supply of 19,000 sheets, or 1,900,000 stamps, equal in value to 132,000
dollars, has been obtained from the above firm, costing for their manufacture and
incidentals 901.50 dollars.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“It will be seen that there is no mention made of the Two Cent stamp. This
value was not issued till some time after the other stamps had been, for the reason
that there was no use for it until what was called the ‘County Postage Act’ came
into force. The following extract from the Postmaster-General’s Report is self-explanatory:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘To enable me to carry out that part of the Act, passed during the last
session, in reference to the Post-office reducing the postage to two cents on a letter
posted in a county for delivery within the said county, it was necessary to procure
for the public convenience a stamp for the prepayment of this particular class of
letters. Application was accordingly made to the New York American Bank
Note Co. for a supply, and 5000 sheets were procured at a cost to the Department,
including die, of 226 dollars.</p>

<p>“‘The reduced rate came into operation on the 11th May last, and has yielded
for the first five months, ended 30th September last (as far as I have been enabled
to glean from the returns in my possession) a revenue of 450 dollars, a less amount,
in my opinion, than would have been realized under the higher rate for the same
period.’</p>

</div>

<p>“The following list will give us the precise date of all except the One Penny.
Of it I can do no more than give the year, and about the probable time, judging
from the Postmaster-General’s Report. The list is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“THE SURCHARGED AND PROVISIONAL STAMPS OF NOVA SCOTIA.</p>

<p>“The title of this is no doubt startling, but it is true nevertheless. It is a
well-known fact in Philately that nearly every country has some stamps, provisional
or error, that are not found in catalogues, but which are nevertheless known to
exist, as the St. Pierre Miquelon P.D., the Bremen Marken error, and so in
Nova Scotia we have the so-called surcharges. In February of this year I
received a parcel of old Nova Scotia stamps from a friend in Port Hastings,
Cape Breton, and among them I found three Three Penny stamps, with 5 c.
in an oval printed on them. They had all been cut out of the envelopes,
having a part of the paper as a margin, and as I had in writing for them
specified the dates between which the Pence issues would be found, all the
stamps had the respective dates of the letters pencilled on the backs of them.
Immediately taking the three surcharged stamps I returned them, and asked if the
envelopes from which they were cut could be sent me, and I was lucky enough to
get them. I then thought I had a bonanza, a regular surcharged stamp of Nova
Scotia, overlooking the fact that there were no other cancellation marks on them.
The three letters had all been mailed from the same office, Baddeck, within a month—January
13th, 20th, the third the day of the month does not show, 1860—and all
addressed to the same person. To make me more sure of the fact of their being
really a surcharge, I saw in No. 304 of <i>Le Timbre Poste</i> an illustration of one which
was in the collection of M. de Ferrari, and which was precisely the same as the
three I had. Being informed that the postmaster who is now at Baddeck, was the
same as was there in 1860, I decided to write him for information on the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
and find out how those stamps came to be surcharged. Imagine my disappointment
when I received the following answer:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Baddeck, Nova Scotia</span>, <i>April 24th, 1888</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—Twenty-eight years ago I made my own stamps out of wood,
and had the 5 c. one that appears on envelopes enclosed. Without any order I
used the latter in manner thereon as I do now in a hurry with ink or date
stamp. Enclosed paper shows stamps then in use, but I cannot find the 5 c. one.
I could tell you how the wind blew and the temperature forty years ago, but I
had a job to find the old stamps.</p>

<p class="right">“‘(Signed) <span class="smcap">Robert Elmsly</span>.’</p>

</div>

<p>“The stamps referred to in the letter were impressions from the old hand
stamps in his office. To understand the latter part of this letter thoroughly, it
must be understood that it was a rule of the Nova Scotia Post Office Department
(and is now of the Canadian) that a stamp should not be cancelled with pen and
ink, or with date stamp, but with a cancellor, so that in case the stamp should come
off the postmark would be on the envelope, and the origin of the letter could thus
be found. This of course could not be done if the postmark was on the stamp.
The objection to ink was that it could be cleaned, and the stamp used again.
This letter, of course, exploded the idea of a surcharge. Not long after this
Mr. J. N. Crane showed me an envelope he had, which was mailed from
Whycocomagh, C.B., February 29th, 1860, with a pair of Six Penny stamps with the
figure 10 surcharged on each; but, as in my own case, there was no other
cancellation on them. Mr. Crane’s theory is, that as the currency was changed
to dollars and cents in the beginning of 1860, and that as 6d. was then worth
only 10 c., that the postmaster at Whycocomagh put it on the Six Penny
stamps to show that he sold them for that price. If this was the case I should
think more would be found, and until then I will continue to believe that this
surcharge was only an accidental cancellation, although in support of Mr. Crane’s
argument there is a figure five alongside of my own Three Penny stamp, illustrated.
It seems, however, a singular coincidence that his and mine should be mailed at
almost the same dates, Mr. Crane’s being mailed at Whycocomagh, 1860. Another
manner in which those stamps are likely to be thus overprinted is this: In 1854
there was a new postal treaty arranged between the United States and Nova Scotia,
one of the agreements of which was that the rate should be 3d. per ½ ounce,
and that all prepaid letters sent by Nova Scotia to the United States should be
stamped on the face of them ‘<span class="allsmcap">PAID 5 CENTS</span>,’ the equal in United States currency
to 3d., or 10 cents if it was a double rate. This may have been occasionally
struck on the stamp accidentally, and would thus make a surcharge. I have
myself seen an envelope in which the edge of the paid stamp has missed the
Three Pence stamp by only a hair-breadth. Some of the surcharges have no
doubt originated in this manner.</p>

<p>“The provisional stamps of Nova Scotia are the split ones, of which only
one value, the Three Penny, was authorized to be so used, and that for a specific
purpose; viz., to allow the rate of postage to Great Britain, 7½d., to be made up.
This cutting of the Three Penny was authorized by the Postmaster-General, as in
his report for 1853 he says, ‘To remedy to some extent the serious inconvenience
said to be experienced by merchants and others in consequence of there being no
Seven and One Halfpenny currency postage stamps, by which parties who feel
desirous could thus prepay their letters to England, and not wishing to put the
province to any further expense in having another “<i>die</i>” prepared, I considered
it expedient to allow <i>half</i> stamps to be used with those now in use to obviate
the want of accommodation complained of; and a circular was accordingly
forwarded to my deputies, and a notice issued to the public to the effect that
letters could be prepaid to England by stamps, by parties using a Six Pence
or two Three Penny stamps together with <i>half a Three Penny stamp</i>. The
Three Penny stamp to be cut diagonally, and the half to be equivalent to 1½d.
The Three Penny stamp alone to be used for that purpose.’</p>

<p>“Of the authorised split stamps I have met with five varieties. The Six
Penny cut diagonally, and used as three pence; also Six Penny, but cut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
perpendicularly, an extremely rare variety, which is the only one I have ever seen
cut in this manner. I have also seen three other varieties; they are the Ten
Cents, cut diagonally and used as Five Cents, also cut perpendicularly and used
for same; and the Five Cents, cut diagonally and used for the county postage of
two cents.</p>

<p>“Another variety I have found is an oddity; it is a Six Penny cut, and used
for what? Under it is written in red pencil ‘<span class="allsmcap">5 CTS.</span>’ I have two almost the same;
the other has, however, only the figure 5 in red under the half stamp. The stamps
have undoubtedly prepaid the letter, as the colour in which the ‘<span class="allsmcap">5 CTS.</span>’ is written
shows it, red being the paid colour. They probably originated at some small post-office
out of stamps, and who marked them in red as paid letters, and sent them
and the money for stamps to the next post-office; or they were given by some one
on the road to a mail courier (as was the practice then as now), with the money to
prepay them, and he marked them in red as prepaid, and had them stamped at the
nearest post-office.</p>

<p>“All the split stamps of Nova Scotia are very rare, and should be greatly
valued by collectors. Off the original envelope they are valueless, and I have been
sorely disappointed more than once on receiving them in that condition. While in
Nova Scotia we have not got those varieties of types in stamps which some other
countries have; still, we can make up a number of interesting varieties which are
unknown to most collectors, and in nearly every case have never been mentioned
in catalogues.</p>

<p><i>Varieties.</i>—All three stamps are found cut in two and used for half the
nominal values, although, as we see from Mr. King’s paper, the Three Pence was
alone authorized to be mutilated in this manner.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—The colour of the paper varies considerably, from deep blue to
almost white.</p>

<p>All the surcharges catalogued on the stamps of this issue may be put down to
obliterations, or as due to fraud. (<i>Vide</i> Mr. King’s papers.)</p>

<h4>Issue II. May 1st(?), 1853.</h4>

<p><i>One value.</i> Engraved and printed in <i>taille-douce</i> by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon,
and Co., upon stoutish blue wove paper; yellowish gum, imperforate. Design:
Diademed almost full-face portrait of Queen Victoria looking to left, within a
single plain-lined lozenge-shaped frame with engine-turned background. The
spandrels are filled in with arabesque ornamentation, in which four eight-rayed
stars, that are cut in half by the lozenge-shaped frame, figure prominently. At the
top, bottom, and two sides there are narrow coloured bands, composed of diagonal
crossed lines, containing inscriptions in plain Roman capitals. Plain square blocks
in the four corners, with coloured Roman numeral of value. Shape, square.

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—Specimens of this stamp are known upon white paper, but, like the
Three Pence of New Brunswick, the variety is only due to the discharge of the
blue colouring matter from the paper.</p>

<p>This is the only stamp of Nova Scotia Mr. King is unable to give the exact
day of issue of. A note in <i>The Philatelic Record</i>, vol. x. page 48, states that the
first supply was sent over to the Colony by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon, and Co. in
April, 1853; so the issue most likely took place on or about May 1st in that year.</p>

<h4>Issue III. October 1st, 1860.</h4>

<p><i>Five values.</i> Engraved and printed by the American Bank Note Co., of New
York, on yellowish or white wove paper; yellowish gum, machine-perforated, 12.
Designs: <span class="smcap">One Cent</span> and <span class="smcap">Five Cents</span>.—Diademed profile of Queen Victoria to left,
upon a background of horizontal lines, crossed by diagonal lines behind the head,
within a circle composed of a plain white and a fine coloured line, arched scrolls of
diagonal lines, crossed above and below, following the shape of the circle; curved
labels of solid colour in the centre of the scrolls on the Five Cents value only.
The scrolls of the One Cent and labels of the Five Cents are inscribed, in white
Roman capitals, with the name of the Colony above and the value in words below.
The remainder of the design is completed by arabesques and foliate ornamentation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
which encompasses the two scrolls and the circle. <span class="smcap">Eight and a Half</span>, <span class="smcap">Ten</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Twelve and a Half Cents</span>.—Diademed full-face portrait of Queen Victoria
on background of horizontal and diagonal crossed lines, within an upright oval.
Vertically-lined arched scrolls above and below, for the two lower values, inscribed
with the name of the Colony above and the value in words below in white Roman
capitals. The Twelve and a Half Cents has the upper inscription upon a curved
label of solid colour, placed in the centre of the scroll. The lower inscription is in
block letters, upon a straight octagonal label of solid colour. The remainder of the
designs are filled in with arabesques and foliate ornamentation, which differ for each
of the three values. Shape, upright rectangular. (<a href="#illus6"><i>Illustrations 90, 91, 92, 93, 94.</i></a>)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.</h2>

</div>

<h3>PRELIMINARY NOTES.</h3>

<p class="center"><i><span class="smcap">By E. D. BACON.</span></i></p>

<p>This island is situated between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64° W.
long. Its area is about 1,380,000 acres; it is about 140 miles long, and 34 its
greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled
by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to Nova Scotia
in 1763, but, on the petition of its inhabitants, was constituted a separate colony in
1770. By an Act passed in 1798, which came into operation 1st February, 1799,
the island received its present name from Prince Edward, Duke of Kent.</p>

<p>The introduction of postage stamps into the Colony took place on January 1st,
1861, as the following notice from <i>The Royal Gazette</i> of that date, published at
Charlottetown, proves:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“POSTAGE STAMPS.</p>

<p>“The Public are hereby informed that stamps for the prepayment of Letters
and Packets to be sent by the Post will, on the 1st January, 1861, be ready
for circulation. The design, colour, and value of each class of stamps are as
follows:</p>

<p>“The <i>blue</i> or <i>red</i> stamp will be received for payment of half the sum it
indicates, if cut in two diagonally.</p>

<p>“These stamps can be had at the General Post Office, Charlottetown,
and of all Postmasters on the island.</p>

<p class="right">“(Signed) <span class="smcap">L. C. Owen</span>, <i>Postmaster-General</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">General Post Office</span>, <i>December 26th, 1860</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>We see from this notice the first issue consisted of three stamps, forming five
values with the two provisionals. Those first issued were evidently the Two Pence,
Three Pence, and Six Pence, perforated 9, as they are the only values found
with this large perforation. With regard to the two provisionals, Mr. T. K.
Tapling’s collection contains a specimen of the Three Halfpenny, but I have never
seen the bisected Two Pence. The latter probably could only be employed
for the prepayment of books, &amp;c., and consequently the stamps would get
destroyed. It may be also this provisional was soon replaced by the One Penny,
orange-yellow, when there would be no further call for its use. The disappearance
of the variety, although in this case we know the stamp was so used, naturally
strengthens the suggestions I have thrown out as regards the bisection of the
Two Pence Halfpenny and Three Penny stamps of British Columbia for the
prepayment of newspapers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>I am unable to give the date of issue of the One Penny and Nine Pence, as I
have found no mention of these two stamps in <i>The Royal Gazette</i>; but the file I
have had access to is a very incomplete one, several years being missing altogether
from the series. The Nine Pence currency stamp, equal to 6d. sterling, was
evidently issued for the prepayment of letters to England, as the ½ oz. rate for
letters between the two countries at that time was 6d. sterling. Here let me
remark that the currency of the island was apparently more depreciated than that
of the other North American Colonies, where we have seen 7½d. currency was equal
to 6d. sterling.</p>

<p>The next notice, taken from <i>The Royal Gazette</i> for October 22nd, 1868, shows
us the reason for the issue of the Four Penny stamp, which came into use at
this date or shortly afterwards.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“NOTICE.</p>

<p>“His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in Council has been pleased to approve

Letter shall be <span class="smcap">Four Pence</span>, if prepaid at the mailing office, and Ten Cents
(equal to Six Pence) if posted unpaid; and for other than single Letters
the same charge shall be made for each additional half ounce, or fraction
thereof. Letters for British Columbia, California, and Oregon shall be

<p>Mr. Thomas Owen became Postmaster-General on April 30th, 1867, in place
of Mr. Peter Des Brisay, who succeeded Mr. L. C. Owen. Mr. John Andrew
McDonald was appointed to the office on January 15th, 1869, in place of Mr.
Thomas Owen, deceased.</p>

<p><i>The Royal Gazette</i> for May 27th, 1870, contains the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“REDUCTION OF POSTAGE TO GREAT BRITAIN.</p>

</div>

<p>And in the issue of <i>The Royal Gazette</i> of June 10th, 1870, this notice is
found:</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>The first of these two notices gives us the approximate date and cause of issue
of the Three Pence sterling (4½d. currency), brown stamp. It is possible the stamp
was not ready for issue on June 1st, as Mr. Tapling’s collection contains a copy of
the Nine Pence cut in half and used as 4½d. This variety is said to have been
taken off a letter sent to England in 1870, so it is possible the Nine Pence was
bisected and used provisionally previous to the issue of the brown stamp. If this
was so, and the new stamp was not ready at the alteration of the rate, the issue
no doubt took place shortly afterwards. This Four Pence Halfpenny stamp was
engraved by the British American Bank Note Co., of Montreal and Ottawa;
the earlier stamps of the Colony being produced by Charles Whiting, printer, of
Beaufort House, Strand, London. It was this Mr. Whiting who sent in so many
essays and suggestions to the Government previous to the introduction of postage
stamps in Great Britain. As collectors know, many of these designs are beautiful
works of art compared with the mean engraving of the stamps of Prince Edward
Island, but perhaps the price offered for the stamps at the time they were ordered
had a good deal to do with their poor workmanship.</p>

<p>In 1871 an Act was passed to establish a decimal system of currency in the
Island, which came into operation on January 4th, 1872. I have found no notice
in <i>The Gazette</i> of the issue of the set of stamps with the values in cents, but
if they were not issued on the same day as the above Act became law, they
came into use shortly afterwards. The stamps of this Colony were withdrawn
from use on July 1st, 1873—the date the Island was admitted into the Dominion
of Canada.</p>

<h3>REFERENCE LIST OF THE PHILATELIC SOCIETY, LONDON.</h3>

<h4>Issue I. January 1st, 1861.</h4>

<p><i>Five values.</i> Lithographed (?) and printed by Mr. Chas. Whiting, of London, upon
medium white wove unwatermarked paper (that used for the stamps first issued being
yellowish in tone); white gum. The entire sheet of each value contains thirty
stamps arranged in six horizontal rows of five, excepting the Two Pence, which has
sixty in six horizontal rows of ten. Designs: The same diademed profile of Queen
Victoria to left does duty for all five stamps, and the inscriptions are all in white
block letters. The <span class="smcap">One Penny</span> has the head upon a reticulated background,
enclosed within a band of solid colour, which touches the four sides of the stamp,
and is curved at the four corners. The band is inscribed at the left top and right
side with the name of the Colony and the word “<span class="allsmcap">POSTAGE</span>,” and at the bottom
with the value in words. The four corners of the stamp contain small conventional
ornaments, and an outer line of colour completes the design. <span class="smcap">Two Pence.</span>—The
head of Her Majesty rests upon a reticulated background of a different pattern
to that of the One Penny, and is enclosed within a circular band of solid colour,
inscribed with the name of the Colony above and “<span class="allsmcap">POSTAGE</span>” below. Straight
label of solid colour at the bottom of the stamp, with the value in full. The
spandrels are filled in with reticulations of the same pattern as the One Penny,
and the design is completed by a single outer coloured line. The <span class="smcap">Three Pence</span>
is precisely similar to the Two Pence, but the Queen’s head is contained within
an upright oval band. The <span class="smcap">Six Pence</span> is also similar to the Two Pence, excepting
that the head is enclosed within an octagonal band. The <span class="smcap">Nine Pence</span> has Her
Majesty’s head upon a similar background to the One Penny, but enclosed within
a ribbon-like band of solid colour, inscribed with the name of the Colony and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
word “<span class="allsmcap">POSTAGE</span>.” The hand is impinged upon at the bottom by a broad straight label
of solid colour, inscribed in three lines “<span class="allsmcap">NINE PENCE CURRENCY—EQUAL TO—SIXPENCE
STG.</span>,” the first line being curved. Conventional ornaments in the upper corners,
and a plain outer line of colour completes the design. Shape, upright rectangular.
The One Penny and Nine Pence were not issued with the other three values,
and probably did not come into use until the year 1865. (<a href="#illus6"><i>Illustrations 96, 97,

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—The Two Pence, rouletted, is unknown to the Society. The variety
is described in <i>The Halifax Philatelist</i> for November, 1888, page 129. The writer
says the specimen seen was used, and on part of the original envelope “it has a
fine wide margin, and shows the roulette cuts plainly.”</p>

<p>The imperforate stamps are believed to be proofs, and not to have been issued
in this state. A paper on the minor varieties found in these stamps was published
in <i>The Halifax Philatelist</i> for September, 1888. The author is Mr. David Lang,
and the article a very interesting one. The following is a reproduction of it:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“VARIETIES OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND STAMPS.</p>

<p>“This province has the reputation of issuing the worst-looking series of stamps

<p>“<i>Second row, fifth stamp</i>: Full stop between ‘<span class="allsmcap">E</span>’ and ‘<span class="allsmcap">D</span>’ in ‘<span class="allsmcap">EDWARD</span>.’</p>

<p>“<i>Third row, second stamp</i>: ‘<span class="allsmcap">I</span>’ in ‘<span class="allsmcap">ISLAND</span>’ with white dash at top, making

<p>“<i>Second row, fifth stamp</i>: Full stop before ‘<span class="allsmcap">S</span>’ in ‘<span class="allsmcap">STG.</span>,’ apparently put there
instead of after ‘<span class="allsmcap">STG.</span>,’ which has none.</p>

<p><b>“Two Pence, printed in sheets of one hundred; ten rows of ten stamps in each.</b></p>

<p>“<i>Third row, tenth stamp</i>: Part of ‘<span class="allsmcap">T</span>’ in ‘<span class="allsmcap">TWO</span>’ off, making it look like
inverted <span class="allsmcap">I</span>. Full stop before ‘<span class="allsmcap">T</span>’ in ‘<span class="allsmcap">TWO</span>.’</p>

</div>

<p>“In the older printing of the One Penny a peculiarity exists which some
of our readers may have in a complete form; that is, an outer line all around the
stamp. I have four specimens with this line in the golden yellow and yellow-brown
shades, perforated 12. Specimen No. 1 was the last stamp in the row, and
has the marginal part of the sheet attached to it. The line is the full length of the
right hand side of the stamp, the perforation going directly through it. No. 2 has
the line on left hand side and bottom, the full length and width of stamp, with
traces of it showing on perforation at top and right hand side. No. 3 has line
showing in parts at left hand side and at bottom. No. 4 shows only at bottom.
The last two are of the yellow-brown shade.</p>

<p>“This peculiarity may also be found in the Four Pence, but parts of the line
only showing. A peculiarity of the Four Pence is that in the diamond, on each
side of the stamp, there is a small oval ornament, which has in the diamond on the
right hand side of the stamp a small line to it at top and bottom, but on the oval
at the left hand side none at all in any. The Cent issue with one exception is free
from those errors or secret marks, or whatever they may be. The one is in the
Three Cents, which are printed in sheets of one hundred, ten rows of ten stamps in
each. The seventh stamp of the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth rows has a
full stop between ‘<span class="allsmcap">PRINCE</span>’ and ‘<span class="allsmcap">EDWARD</span>,’ thus ‘<span class="allsmcap">PRINCE. EDWARD</span>.’ The varieties
in the Pence issue mentioned above are, I think, some kind of secret marks,
although they are not found in a regular rotation as in the Three Cent, being
arbitrarily scattered here and there over each sheet, the varieties of each stamp
when they occur being precisely the same, so that it is hardly possible that such a
series of errors could be made unintentionally; but of this some one with more

supplied the principal stamp dealers throughout the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note by Mr. T. K. Tapling, M.P.</span>—In <i>The Stamp Collector’s Magazine</i>, vol. x.
p. 105, will be found an amended notice relating to the values constituting the
above issue. Among them is catalogued a Ten Cents on the authority of <i>The
American Journal of Philately</i>. Some discussion arose subsequently as to the
authenticity of this value, but the mystery attaching to it seems never to have been
wholly cleared up. Very few specimens were seen, and these appear to have been
obtained by M. Moens from what he considered a thoroughly satisfactory source.
Much doubt has been thrown upon the stamp by English writers; but a few weeks
since I was shown a specimen in Mr. Pearson Hill’s collection, which he told me
had been there over seventeen years. Mr. Hill’s connection with our General Post
Office enabled him to get nearly all his stamps direct from Foreign and Colonial
Governments, and his impression is that this stamp reached him in the same way.
It is similar in design to the Three Pence of the first issue, of which it is apparently
a copy, though the details are rather larger and the general appearance rougher. It
is a companion in style and execution to the issue of which it is supposed to form
a part, and the perforation (machine 12) is identical. The colour is dull mauve.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
It is possible that the stamp was prepared and never issued, though even in this
case Mr. Hill might quite well have had a specimen sent him with the others by the
Prince Edward Island Government; but if it was merely a fraudulent speculation it
seems strange that copies are, and always have been, exceedingly uncommon. I
venture no definite opinion either one way or the other, and hope this short note
may draw an answer from some one qualified to speak with certainty.</p>

<p>Since the Catalogue was printed, the members of the Committee entrusted with
its publication have had the opportunity of consulting <i>The Halifax Philatelist</i>
for the current year (1889), the numbers of which had not previously been seen
by them.</p>

<p>The May number contains a copy of a recently-published Canadian postal
notice, referring to certain alterations in the rates, &amp;c.; and in the numbers for
January and February Mr. Donald A. King has two further papers upon the stamps
of Nova Scotia; while the April number contains a letter from a correspondent upon
the bisected stamp of New Brunswick. The Committee consider it advisable to
reproduce here all the four articles mentioned, feeling sure their contents will be of
interest to philatelists, and help to add further to the completeness of the postal
history of each of the provinces.</p>

<h3>NEW BRUNSWICK.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“COMMENTS ON THE SPLIT STAMPS OF NEW BRUNSWICK.</p>

<p class="center">“(<i>To the Editor of ‘The Halifax Philatelist.’</i>)</p>

<p>“Having examined your plate of Nova Scotia split stamps and oddities, I would
like to mention a few notes on the split or provincial stamps of New Brunswick.
In the catalogue list of the Nova Scotia Philatelic Association I find that there are
but two of these split or provisional stamps offered, both Nova Scotia Six Pence,
cut diagonally and used as Three Pence, and not one split New Brunswick.</p>

<p>“To all appearances, and from what I can learn, I think there were very few of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
these provisional stamps of New Brunswick used, and therefore they are very rare.
I have never seen but three or four on the original envelopes, and have but two in
my collection—a Ten Cent, vermilion, New Brunswick, cut in half vertically, and used
as a Five Cent stamp. It is on the original envelope, and is postmarked ‘St. John,
Nov. 5, 1860,’ and ‘Kingston, Nov. 6, 1860.’ I have also heard of the Ten Cent,
vermilion, being cut <i>diagonally</i> instead of vertically, but have not seen any so used.</p>

<p>“As the second issue of New Brunswick first came into use in 1860, I presume
the supply of Five Cent stamps ran short, and thus suggested the splitting of the
Ten Cent, vermilion, stamps.</p>

<p>“I have also heard of the Six Penny stamps being cut both diagonally and
horizontally, and used as Three Penny, but have not seen but one so used.</p>

<p>“Can any of my brother collectors tell what rate was charged for single or
double letters to Australia in 1860? On the 9th of this month I received from
New Brunswick an envelope which had been sent out to Melbourne, Australia, in
1860. It was mailed at Kingston, N.B., in May, 1860, and went <i>viâ</i> London.
On the envelope, which is yellow, are a One Shilling, violet, and one half of a Six
Pence, yellow, cut in half diagonally, and presumably used as Three Pence, making
a total of fifteen pence, quite a high rate for a single letter, as such I presume it to
be. The Six Penny stamp is very bright, but the One Shilling is somewhat faded.</p>

<p>“I would like to know if any of the readers of <i>The Halifax Philatelist</i> have
ever seen any of the high values thus combined, as I think they are very rare, and
should occupy a prominent place in the representation of New Brunswick stamps
in all collections.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Fred. Northrup</span>, <i>Port Jervis, N. Y.</i></p>

</div>

<p>“[The split stamps of New Brunswick are no doubt scarce, but they are not
more so than any of the other B. N. A. Provinces. Canada seems to be the only
one which did not do this, as split stamps from there are very scarce. The rate on
a half-ounce Letter from Nova Scotia to Victoria was one shilling and threepence,
and we presume it was the same from New Brunswick.—<span class="smcap">Editor</span> of <i>The Halifax
Philatelist</i>.]”</p>

the issue of May 13th, 1860, on page 30 of the Catalogue:</p>

<h3>NOVA SCOTIA.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“SOME OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE FIRST ISSUE OF
NOVA SCOTIA STAMPS.</p>

<p>“The postal service of the British-American provinces, until the year 1851, was
directly under the control of the English Post Office Department. This, with the
high rate of postage, the insufficient mail accommodation, and the stringent laws
against a private person carrying or delivering a Letter on the post road, was the
cause of innumerable complaints on the part of the Colonies, and gave the English
Post Office officials the trouble of sending out long despatches.</p>

<p>“The Colonies complained that the English Post Office took a large amount of
revenue, derived from the postal service, which the Colonies were not able to lose
out of the country. The English officials said that there was an annual deficit in
Nova Scotia alone of £2,000 per annum. This state of things existed for years,
and every annual report of the Post Office Commissioners which was laid on the
table of the local Legislature was full of complaints under this head. To give a
specimen from one of the reports of these Post Office Commissions, the following is
extracted from their annual report for the year 1844 in Nova Scotia. After speaking
in favour of a large reduction in postal rates, they say: ‘This, with the use of post
stamps from dies authorized by the proper authorities, would render the transit of
Letters and Papers less complicated, and give the relief required by the people.’</p>

<p>“To this no answer was returned till some time in 1845, when a long despatch
was received from the Postmaster-General of Great Britain, Lord Lonsdale, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
thus gives his Department’s views of the issue of postage stamps for Nova Scotia
as follows: ‘The suggestion that postage stamps for Letters should be introduced
into Nova Scotia is one which I cannot recommend your lordship (Viscount
Falkland, then Governor of Nova Scotia) to entertain, as I cannot but consider
that considerable objections exist to such a measure, and particularly from the
facility which it would afford to the circulation of forged stamps, with but little
chance of detection; while it is believed that the offence, if committed in the
United Kingdom, could not be punished in the Colony, while on the other hand
if committed in the Colony it could be visited with no penalty on parties in the
United Kingdom.’ This will give some idea of the narrow-mindedness of the
English postal administration of that time.</p>

<p>“As a specimen of the postal accommodation of the province, see this: From
Halifax to Truro, by the coach road, was a distance of eighty-three miles, and
between those two points there were only two post-offices for all the people between
these places. The mail couriers were not allowed to deliver mail on the way.</p>

<p>“At last by a united effort of all the Colonies (Canada, New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia, Newfoundland, and P. E. Island), the English Government turned over the
postal administration to the different provincial governments. From this date
(July 1st, 1851), the interesting part of the postal history of these provinces
commences.</p>

<p>“In the Post Office Department’s Letter Book the first reference to postage
stamps is in the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Halifax</span>, <i>April 21st, 1851</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—As the period is fast drawing near when the reduced rate of postage
is to take effect in Nova Scotia, and as I perceive, by the Provincial Act that
provincial stamps are to be provided for the convenience of the public, and not
being aware that any steps have been taken by the Government to obtain them, I
request to be informed whether His Excellency would authorize me to make
application for a supply from the authorities of the General Post Office.</p>

<p>“‘I would beg to suggest that a requisition for 5,000 sheets or more be
made, each sheet containing 240 heads, which, at threepence, would be equal to
£15,000, or £3 for each sheet.</p>

<p>“‘Also, £5,000 of Six Penny stamps for double Letters, or Letters exceeding
the half ounce; and also sixty “<i>defacing stamps</i>,” for the use of the several
postmasters throughout the province.</p>

<p>“‘I would further suggest that the <i>head</i> should be something similar to that
represented in the margin; the field to be <i>blue</i> instead of red, or any other colour
His Excellency would prefer.</p>

<p>“‘This supply would, I imagine, be sufficient for the first introduction of
this reduced rate, when, should His Excellency think proper, other arrangements
could be made for keeping up the supply.</p>

<p>“‘Should the Lieutenant-Governor approve of this proposition, I will apply
to the Post Office in London by the next packet.</p>

<p class="center">“‘I have, etc.,</p>

<p class="right">“‘(Signed) <span class="smcap">A. Woodgate</span>.</p>

<p>“‘<i>The Honourable Joseph Howe.</i>’”</p>

</div>

<p>“A copy of the design mentioned in this letter is on the margin of the Letter
Book. It is a large rectangular shape, in centre the head of the Queen, of a type
somewhat like the early Mauritius, excepting that there is not any crown or wreath
on head. This is drawn on a square of red—at top, ‘<span class="allsmcap">POSTAGE</span>;’ bottom, ‘Three
Pence’ in small script writing; left side, ‘<span class="allsmcap">NOVA</span>’ reading up, and at right side
‘<span class="allsmcap">SCOTIA</span>’ reading down; in each corner a small square, with figure ‘3’ in it. The
whole look of the design is much like the early Mauritius.</p>

<p>“The ‘defacing’ or cancelling stamp’s design was very much like the one
adopted, being the same oval shape; but the lines on the face were perpendicular
instead of horizontal, and the space for inserting the office a diamond instead of
circular shape.</p>

<p>“This design for stamps did not likely go further than the office of the
Provincial Secretary, to whom it was written, and it appears that stamps must have
been ordered before this, as there does not appear to be time enough between this
date and that when stamps were issued (September 1st, 1851) to have designs
approved of and plates prepared. It is more than probable that the Hon. Joseph
Howe, the Provincial Secretary, who, I am informed, was in London the winter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
previous, had designs then submitted to him and approved of, and ordered the
necessary stamps without the knowledge of the Postmaster-General. At the same
time he apparently had the power to decide on the design of the New Brunswick
stamps, as may be inferred from the following memorandum; or perhaps the stamps
of both Colonies were bought together for the sake of economy. The memorandum
is dated July 8th, 1851, and is copied from the same letter-book:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“‘MEMO.</p>

<p>“‘When Mr. Howe made the application for stamps, it was proposed that,
after the first supply had arrived, the plates could have been sent out, and
impressions taken off by engravers in Halifax. As Mr. Saunders, however, seems
to report against the proposition, I would beg to suggest, for the consideration of
the Government, that £10,000 worth of stamps for Nova Scotia, and a similar
amount for New Brunswick; viz.—</p>

<table summary="Breakdown of stamps requested">

  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">be furnished for immediate use; or, should this amount be considered too small,
to double the above numbers.</p>

<p>“‘I would also recommend that 200 half-pound canisters of obliterating ink
be also provided—100 for the use of this province, and 100 for New Brunswick—and
directions for its use.</p>

<p class="right">“‘(Signed) A. W.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">W. H. Keating</span>, Esq., <i>July 8th, 1851</i>.’</p>

</div>

<p>“What amount of stamps was ordered could not be found out, nor can any
trace of further orders be found until 1857, when an application letter was sent to
the Provincial Secretary, and which will be copied later on.</p>

<p>“It was mentioned in above letter that a proposal was made that the plates
should be sent out, and stamps wanted could be printed from here. This seems to
be the opinion among English philatelists, as Mr. W. A. S. Westoby says in a
letter to me of February 6th, 1888, that he was informed by the makers of the
plates—Messrs. Perkins, Bacon, and Co.—that the plates of the Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick stamps were sent out here on the same day—August 6th, 1851.</p>

<p>“On receipt of this, I wrote Mr. F. M. Passow, who was chief clerk of the
Nova Scotian Post Office Department, to enquire whether the plates ever came here.
He said, ‘I doubt if the plates were ever sent out to Halifax; I never saw them.’
To make this positive, we find, in the letter to the Provincial Secretary above
referred, indisputable evidence that the plates were in England in 1857. The
letter is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">General Post Office, Halifax</span>, <i>July 2nd, 1857</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—The stock of postage stamps procured from England some time ago

enough to issue the necessary directions to Mr. Stanford, No. 6, Charing Cross,

stamps, making each sheet of the value of £2, £4, and £8 respectively, and to be
the colour of those affixed on the margin.</p>

<p>“‘The last supply of stamps was furnished by Mr. Trelawney Saunders,
who has transferred his business to Mr. Stanford. In applying for these postage
labels, therefore, it will be necessary you should furnish Mr. Stanford with your
authority to produce the key for opening the box containing the dies, which are
now in the possession of the engravers, Messrs. Perkins, Bacon, and Petch, who
also are in possession of a key for the safe custody of the dies.</p>

<p>“‘It is particularly requested that the stamps may be forwarded at as early a
period as possible, those remaining on hand being not only nearly expended, but
much injured. When making the requisition, it would be as well to caution the
engravers not to pack the parcels too close; for when they are strictly confined
they adhere, and become useless, as was the case with some of the packages in the
last supply furnished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“Only two requisitions for stamps (those of July 8th, 1851 and July 2nd,
1857) for Nova Scotia can be found, although no doubt more than two supplies
were sent.</p>

<p>“Of those the Three Pence, dark blue, Six Pence, yellow-green, and the light
shade of the One Shilling, are the earlier issue. After examination of a large
number of specimens of the two lower values on the original cover, a dark blue
Three Pence or yellow-green Six Pence is seldom found after November, 1857.
From that date the light blue Three Pence and dark green Six Pence is the rule.
At the time the last supplies were sent out, in 1857, some sheets of the Three
Pence and Six Pence were printed on an intensely blue paper, as I have in my
collection a Six Pence on this blue paper split and used as Three Pence on original
cover, postmarked ‘Lunenburg, Dec, 7, 1859,’ and an entire one, on envelope
from same place, ‘Feb. (date indistinct), 1860.’ The Three Pence is on a much
bluer paper than the ordinary dark shades of same on blue paper of the earlier
issue. Of the Six Pence on blue paper I have only seen four specimens, and I
have examined a large number of that value.</p>

tinted blue on face by the ink, or insufficiently-cleaned plates. The Six Pence

<p class="center">“DATE OF ISSUE OF THE ONE PENNY NOVA SCOTIA.</p>

<p>“While the exact date of issue of the Three Pence, Six Pence, and One Shilling
Nova Scotia stamps has been discovered, that of the One Penny has only been
guessed at. Having lately been fortunate enough to procure access to the letter-books
of the Nova Scotia Post Office Department, I have been enabled to make the
date almost exact, as will be seen by the following letter of the Postmaster-General
of Nova Scotia, and copied from the letter book of that Department:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Halifax</span>, <i>May 12th, 1853</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I have the honour to request that I may be furnished with a supply
of <a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>200 sheets of One Penny stamps (amounting to £100), for the use of the Post
Office in this Province.</p>

<p class="right">“‘(Signed) <span class="smcap">A. Woodgate</span>, <i>Postmaster-General</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Receiver-General of Nova Scotia.</i>’</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[A]</a> The sheet of the One Penny therefore contained 120 stamps, while those of the Three
Pence, Six Pence, and One Shilling, as we see from Mr. A. Woodgate’s letter of July 2nd, 1857,
were each composed of 160 stamps.</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>“This is the first mention of the One Penny stamps in the letter-book, and the
date of issue should, I think, be taken from that application. In the letter-book
containing copies of letters to deputies, the first requisition for One Penny stamps
is from the Postmaster of Amherst, the answer to which, here given, is:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“‘<span class="smcap">Halifax</span>, <i>June 30th, 1853</i>.</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—I beg to enclose herewith, agreeably to your request, postage stamps
to the amount of £2 5s.; viz., one sheet of Three Pence and sixty labels of One
Penny stamps. Also a supply of the proper printed applications, one of which I
will thank you to fill up and return to this office with the acknowledgment.</p>

<p class="center">“‘I am, &amp;c. &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="right">“‘(Signed) C. H. H.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Postmaster, Amherst.</i>’</p>

</div>

<p>“Amherst was then one of the largest towns of this Province, outside of the
capital, and the amount of the One Penny required shows the small use of this
value outside Halifax. The requisitions show that this was the usual number of
One Penny stamps asked for, sometimes a little more, and very often less, and,
being used as they were for a merely town or drop postage, accounts for their
scarcity.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
